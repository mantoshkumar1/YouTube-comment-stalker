Y’all are blaming Apple for the actions of the concerted efforts of thieves targeting people in and outside bars. And if a thief didn’t know how to lock the owner out of their account, this story just educated them.
Yup all in third party managers, store all your info there and when it gets hacked, all the same!
Great reporting!!! Never put all your eggs in one basket and never treat one product or service as infallible. Any bit of data nomatter how insignificant can and will be used against you by thieves. Be shrewd & vigilant! Also, while third party password managers can help break up this risk, they are also not immune to vulnerabilities as even Last Past recently reported being hacked and user data being leaked which is a nightmare. I say… have a different password unlock or FaceID unlock for everything possible and strong 2FA when available including specific emails not signed into on a said device and with no login info saved on said device… physical keys, etc.
Apple needs to create a Face ID-only mode. They’ll need a disclaimer that it is not protected under the 5th amendment but it would negate this whole issue.
Just FYI if you’re using a third-party password manager I would consider thinking again. Last pass which was my password manager for the last five years or so recently disclose that they’ve been hacked. My passwords are probably safe for now but it’s only a matter of time before they are compromised. Trying to change them is a doable but very tedious and time-consuming process. The state of password management is pretty dang tricky right now. Best of luck.
Apple should get something that scans the face instead of typing in the ID or maybe even one of those cool thumbprint readers 🤔
This only applies to the devices without Touch ID thieves can’t easily get a good finger print I don’t understand why apple removed it, it’s a lot more secure because someone can “shoulder surf” (they peep over your shoulder and see your passcode) and get your passcode also it helps to not have your banking details associated with your IPhone for these instances and it always helps to look around before you start doing anything.
This is why I never use banking or investment apps on my phone.
“Apple security cannot hinge on those six digits.” Use an alphanumeric passcode then 🥱🤧
Even passively recommending LastPass brings down the credibly of this video.
Need another piece of Hardwear and different systems as opposed to phone being the “PRIMARY DEVICE” That approves these changes - in other words a Face Recognition Tag and DNA with another Level Security Sets.
And additionally, Apple needs to implement an option where it needs your Passcode before shutting down the device, because sometimes, thieves simply turns off the device and sell its parts like Display, battery, housing, cameras etc.
So Old school is def better- if you go digital - Game Over- you are opening a can of warms: meaning everyone in the world has PROBOPBILITY OF ACCES VS… TRADITIONAL MAIL For example Reduces that probability…
Hey if someone physically steals your wallet, they can do a lot of damage. It’s the same as having a stolen phone. People should treat it like a wallet
Switch to android, its more secure and gmail is always accessible unlike appleid
I had problem last year of finding a mint locked up iPhone 11 in garbage (Edm, Canada) & not being able to return it for 7 months.  All the supposed experts including Apple, police, & shops told me nothing could be done.  Youtuber Hugh Jeffreys said put SIM card from lost phone in another phone & look up # in About Phone settings & it worked!!!!  Owner got his phone back the same day after losing it 9 months previous.  I had just about given up & was willing to sell phone for $100 for parts that a couple people had offered me.  So, locking up the phone can defeat good samaritans & don't rely on Apple & police.  My recommendation is use Always On display to display an email address & at least a $20 reward to get your phone back the next day.  Only offering a reward upfront will make finder 100% sure he will get paid.  Also, as YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys says, iPhones not reported stolen should be unlocked by Apple, so that I could have used the iPhone eventually if abandoned
I dont have any banking apps on my phone. I suppose they can still use apple pay to but stuff though.
Passcodes are not very secure. That’s why Apple invented face ID.. if you’re allowing somebody to view  entering your code over your shoulder, you’re not exercising, very good personal security.
People today are too dependent on their phones. In Japan, it's considered rude to use your phone in public like in restaurants, on trains, etc. and people will excuse themselves from the table or wait to use it so they aren't bothering others. If your biometric pass isn't working, just wait to use your phone so your numeric passcode isn't compromised in a crowded area.
There’s many videos on how to bypass screen time passcode 

Fyi
I tried it myself and I am asked 2FA and the old passcode to change my AppleID passcode. Maybe they just changed it ?
you can disable that in screen time… use a different code to unlock screen time too… its a feature in your phone and you are saying apple needs to do something! well they did you are just too relaxed with your security
Do 3 easy things.

- Put down phone. 
- Take cash out of bank. 
- Use said cash.
That great Apple privacy & security 🤣🤣🤣
Couldn’t this just be solved with a security question?! That would be a proper MFA implementation, not this “texting the phone that was clearly just stolen” nonsense.
Common sense is not that common.
This is why I have a privacy screen on my phone, turn down the brightness to make it harder to see, and always make sure no one is watching you when entering sensitive information.

Yet again, iPhones are the smartphones for tech illiterates sooo, yeah.
Don’t use LastPass though
Thanks for this video. Face and biometric user. I don't trust 3rd party. Would rather see Apple figure this out quick. Perhaps some one time use code sent by Apple via email on purchase. Use for third try at password or something. 

🤷
Using an alternative password manager was the first mitigation I thought of. Terrifying problem, great advice!
Unless Apple or any other such companies where sensitive info of its customers is held, they should implement a direct face to face method where they can reset user passwords and recover the Account for user in case of theft of devices or such other fraud reports, JUST LIKE BANKS. Otherwise law should FORBID them to provide any such above-mentioned services.
so she doesn't use faceID? smh
Never use a pass code on your phone. Face id is more secure
I use a Titan Key to keep my stuff safe. If anyone trys to change my codes, they'll need to have my key as well.
I will never have any understanding why someone would trust a digital device with all their money, have you not heard of social engineering or hacking?
Require a second passcode for changing Apple ID/password keychain. One passcode for most use/ (unlocking/other low risk app stuff), but then a second passcode for higher risk stuff. Easy.
Using Face ID prevents this
How do "thieves observe the passcode" when most iPhone users are using fingerprint recognition or facial recognition? It's not 2012.
On Android you need to enter the last password you remember before you can set a new one
THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN DECEMBER, Bogota, Colombia !!! It’s happening everywhere
I can’t believe this was posted 4 days ago. I’m scared 😱
Password managers aren't necessarily safe either. LastPass got done good just recently, for instance.
I use Dashlane instead of apple’s built in password manager.  It adds an extra level of protection and it is not tied into the apple ecosystem. I also backup my photos to google!
It’s called situational awareness!
Thats crazy, I dont see this happening in Australia yet. You will need to watch your back and your surroundings when opening the phone. But the best thing I can say is use the fingerprint unlock for added security. Then they will start stealing your fingerprints and using a fake finger to unlock like in Demolition Man movie with the eye ball unlock. Maybe in the fututre we need to leave all tech behind and enjoy time with friends?
This is so dumb, I didn’t know all you needed was the 6 digits to change Apple ID password. It should 100% prompt you for current Apple ID password before changing it. Or if user forgot it, it should prompt security questions to change the code. And if it still doesn’t work, then they can implement an in-person verification process with an Apple Genius to reset the Apple ID password. This is the worst account security I’ve seen…
To be frank, the solution to this is to have a strong password and change it often. It is not Apple’s responsibility to keep you responsible for your passwords. Laziness is not an excuse for blaming someone else. Is your phone is stolen, that’s the thief’s fault. If they learned your simply password and stole your information? That’s partly your fault.
What about facial or fingerprint unlocking? The very reason why theses funcrions are available.
Possible solution: don't use products of Apple.
And yes, that's a real solution. You probably have a friend who works in IT, right? Ask them what exactly are you supposed to do. And proprietary software for personal data is just not a good match.
Normally you need password,  I'm confused. Not just passcode for your apple ID
🤣🤣🤣 I never knew apple never asked you to enter your actual password to change a password, just a normal pin number 🤣🤣🤣 #teampixel baby
LIFE in prison for criminals.  When we're actually lucky enough to CATCH them, do not EVER let them out. EVER! It's much, Much cheaper and ASTRONOMICALLY BETTER to have criminals in prison, NOT in society!
You can't reset anything in an Android with just the passcode. It's implied you can but you can't
I use a samsung
I hat that they got rid of Touch ID
I think these people just don’t know how to use their phone. My phone dropped out of my stroller while taking my daughter for a walk. I immediately walked home in a few minutes and was able to log in to iCloud and completely lock the device so you can’t put a password in and I kept hitting the alarm option so it freaked the heck out of the person who picked it up and kept calling them. Within an hour the person met up with me, I keep tracking the location and the individual gave me my phone and wallet attached with everything in it because they did not want me to report them. Just know how to use your phone.
Iphone users, therefore, at least until apple is unable to fix this, should not go to bars.
Apple is SO secure 😂
I say HIDE the apple ID password in keychain. Require old password, and if not, then require a 24 hour waiting period. Also require Apple ID password to access Keychain, so that the thief cant take over all my other accounts.
Just use Face ID in and Never ever use Passcode in public.
Use Face ID and thrives won’t know your passcode.
Surprising to see Lastpass shown in this video as a recommendation given their own security issues & the specific nature to this video.
"the entirety of your security can't hinge on those six digits" 🤦‍♂

Well, it's not 2010, you shouldn't be using short numeric passcodes, even if bank ATMs still cling to such utterly outdated methods. 🤷‍♂
Just buy a Samsung, problem solved 🙄
Apple should require both Face ID and password and both should be required simultaneously
This is exactly why I use Android. So bad that people keep buying Iphones. I call them Isheep.
There should also be additional questions for such passcode changes
This happened to me in London. Apple refused to believe it was possible. Their response in this video is telling.
@0:41 "How?" Because your passcode is 123456.
People say use screen time passcode, but it doesn‘t work:
- Change Screen Time Passcode
- say you forgot the passcode
- enter apple id
- say you forgot the password
- enter iPhone passcode
- profit
you can't open new credit card without know social security number. don't save identity information
I was with you til the last screenshot!! Lastpass??
well thanks for showing everyone how to steal someone’s money 😂
Imagine using Apple Pay instead of a banking app by an actual bank.
the wall street journal is funded by jeffry bezos and will never publish a positive story about a major competitor. amazon stole my identity and no one even cares about it
Bro if she had a stack of cash and her social security card and drivers license in her car and someone broke the window to steal it she gonna call Chevrolet and be like “y’all need to up the security on your cars”!!!
It’s not apples fault she saved all that info to her mobile device then went out drinking at a bar getting intoxicated while flashing her phone at strangers. Take some personal responsibility for Christs sake.
Third party apps depending on their TOC is another form data leak in itself.
Finger print scanner would undo a lot of this...
This is why I have a card and a phone.
What a fake news reporting!

So a person goes in PUBLIC and TYPES HIS PASSWORD and the problem is the platform and not the person who doesn't protect his password, although he can uses biometrics (TouchID or FaceID).

So, you go to the ATM with your card to withdraw money and type your pin without protection. So the bank is to blame. Cool stuff.
User error. People are not taking security measures. Don’t save pictures of your social security number. Don’t have have your checking account info saved to your device. Use a prepaid debit card on your iPhone. Use your home computer to transfer money from your checking account to your prepaid account. Don’t save your checking account info to your icloud. It’s common sense. People don’t use their brains. Oh and quit drinking alcohol in public. If you must drink do it in the safety of your home or at a trusted friend or family members house. Life is what you make of it.
Great report. Sharing with friends.
I don't have a cell phone....ha ha ha....
Don’t get drunk next to the stranger looking at your passcode 🥴
You shouldn’t be able to change an iCloud password with the phones passcode, it should require the original password as a minimum.
What happened to the thumb print thing they had? Wasn’t that secure enough?
Screen time passcode
im so glad my bank account password cant be saved anywhere as it asks you only for certaain digits every time
Icloud for 15 years????? It was launched in 2011
Seems like the easiest fix for Apple to implement is to have a separate passcode for unlocking the device ONLY. And/or give a warning before using the other passcode like: WARNING: this passcode is linked to your iCloud, passwords, and other sensitive information. Use extreme caution when entering it in public places.
Great, informative video.  I have to disagree with regards to using a third party password manager though.  You show Last Pass as one of the suggested managers and they were recently hacked and a lot of users data was stolen, including mine.  I recommend still using Apple Keychain.  Apple has a lot more resources to secure passwords, and they have a vested interest in their reputation with regards to user security.  I think the best thing that can be done to prevent this from happening is to never use your passcode in public.  I’ve always thought that a 6 digit passcode was a terrible idea on a phone anyway, I rarely use it.  Apple has perfected facial recognition, and most android phones have great fingerprint access.
Nothing good ever happens in a bar.
use face id not a passcode problem solved
"Of all the cases I've investigated, 99% of the cellphones that are stolen have been iPhones, and not Android."
Guess me sticking to android is a good anti-theft measure, along with using cheaper wired earbuds in public instead of bluetooth buds lol
In these three steps I already use complex passwords with numbers letters and others included. However, I use Face ID most of the time unless the device has been reset or shut down and turned on again. But like mentioned in this context it is necessary that we follow in order to reduce the risks of our digital lives.👍🏽😊
Powerful story. Truly sympathize with the victims
fingerprint sensor, FAceID is secured
This is fake. Apple is the most secure ecosystem there is. Only Android users get hacked.
Good reporting.
That's why is so important to have fingerprint id as an extra step to change password
😂😂and they say iphone is data protected? It's all the same in every phone
Wouldn’t be a total fix, i grant you, but couldn’t Apple fix it that the watch uses the same “channel” as the AirTag to mark your phone lost and lock it? Also, could they not have a function that you need to tap your watch screen for sensitive apps?
I wish there was a way to disable the  passcode and use instead just biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
what is missing from reporting and kinda hinted by a cop why its almost never android because androids mostly still have fingerprint sensor. Which what this girl would've used that night instead of passcode after face id failed in a dark bar environment. problem with apple they ditch technology too early at times.
My next device will not be apple
Biometrics???
Moral of the story go to church. Not a bar. Jesus way better and you'll find friends. ⛪👍
This exact thing could be done on any android device with google account.
Simple solution: stop putting all eggs (and trust) in one basket.
Simply before changing the password, apple should apply face Id or fingerprint. Problem solved!
Just use face ID and don't put passcode in... especially in the pub with people you just meet.
Apple should just get the finger ID reader that Samsung has and use that as the only way to reset a password or get into the bank app
so glad i dont use iphone
Fingerprint as a backup to face ID would help this instead of using the code
Okay, why Is this showing LastPass as example of password manager? They have always been the worst in security and after the left breach nobody should really recommend them until they completely address all the issues (e.g. the fact that they do NOT encrypt all data)
2 factor authentication? Deactivate the phone number, hello?????? Damage control…….
This is a pretty massive oversight, given that Apple demands I enter my Apple ID password to install a free app! 🙄 You can even generate new recovery keys with just the passcode. What a mess.
For the 'permanently locked out' problem, Apple should make it progressively easier for people to recover their account the longer it remains unused. The thieves will stop using it within a very few (1?) days, and  so within a week or so it should be recoverable without the passcode. If Apple insisted that everyone using icloud  registered their national insurance number, it should be fairly easy to recover an account to its rightful owner.
Why r they even using the pc
Sponsored by LastPass
Perhaps if you decide to go to a bar, you should leave your phone in your trunk or at home.
Apple made it easy for the thieves
I have never used a banking app on my phone and this is why.  This is not a criticism of these unfortunate victims of theft - I just have never had the desire to take that extra risk.
@Wall Street Journal, consider posting this on the Instagram page as well to reach wider audience.
Would be easier to share and spread the word as well
The better put the  touch id, because the face id doesn’t work as well in dark environment
Put the change password option behind appleID and 2 factor authentication
better buy android and use .
You are forgetting how many more people would be screwed if it wasn't possible to do that with just your passcode.
Why do people frequently go to the bar, where total strangers congregate 24/7, and not use fingerprint or Face ID to unlock their phone?!? Why do they think Apple invented this feature for?!?
I mean jeez, they give you Face ID or Touch ID so you don’t have to enter your password under the watchful eye of anyone…
Excelent information. I never though that thieves can ruin a life storage in my iphone.
Not them only stealing iPhone, feeding too whole stigma that android users are broke 😂

Or maybe because iPhone users are just easier targets
Good journalism! This is a serious risk. Thanks for investigating this phenomenon
Just don't be lazy and DON'T AUTO SAVE YOUR PASSWORDS as simple as that 🤷🤷
Educate yourselves. Apple has 2 step verification and also authenticator keys. I personally have a NFC key.
Not only that, someone can remotely get into your phone as well
Literally all of this is solved by 2FA. Oh my. I cannot get into my bank or anything or do any transfer without 2FA. And each step of that requires separate verifications.

The 2FA is an Authenticator with biometrics and a separate passcode, Not SMS, for obvious reasons. 

See Danish MittID or Swedish BankID etc. all can be locked down with a single call or report.

The iPhone helps by putting that all behind faceID but that is not unlockable in anyway by a passcode.
My passcode and apple ID password are completely different, I use facial scan, and my screen timeout is 30 seconds.  You may get the phone but good luck with the rest of that lol.
I’m sorry. I know theft happens, But sounds like as long as you’re capable of holding on to your phone then this wouldn’t be a problem. Same as your wallet. You wouldn’t blame the wallet company for someone stealing your wallet and having access to your cash. The passcodes and Apple ID are a luxury of extra protection. We all need some kind of self accountability as well.
Oh, and if you get the passcode of an android device, this doesn’t happen?

This is a hit piece
Probably they steal in bar because of low light so that face id won’t work to unlock your iPhone and you’ve to enter your passcode for that, if only there was a fingerprint unlock mechanism in new iPhones, this whole situation can be avoided.
Turning off the find my iPhone app seems like an easy fix of a 24 hour wait period until it actually disables. Who is that desperate to make sure you cant find your own phone? I know there are other reasons but for normal use. There shouldn't be any reason to have to take it off
7:28 yes, in the most basic setup, it absolutely can, but it doesnt necessarily be that way, step up your security people🤦🏻‍♂
How does android security differ from apple?
I bet next time she goes to a New York Bar... she will have a tighter grip on the ole phone.
A police report should satisfy apple to grant access to the cloud backup.
An easy fix would be requiring a delay after requesting a new password (like 24hrs) so to leave the owner enough time to lock the iphone via My Devices.

By the way if you have an apple watch with a passcode you'll never need to put your pin again on your iphone (or mac) they will be unlocked by the apple watch if the biometric authentication fails.
All you need to do is use Face ID or Touch ID, turn off Apple Pay on the Lock Screen and lock all of your financial apps
Apple should have a way to access your account though iCloud, even if someone has stolen your phone and changed the password, why not use a one time password that is written down and kept save and can only be used once to access your personal account on iCloud
Unlike Android, it is impossible to put a password on a important file or a password on any Apps on the iPhone, because Apple Ego gets in the way of the security of the user
ah-PLY-dee
When in bar use Face unlock. Problem Solved
Glad I left Apple's ecosystem a while back. It's never good to have all your eggs in one basket. And Apple is always nonchalant when it comes to their customers. So when you actually need their help, good luck trying to get Apple to do anything for you.
Goodbye 👋 apple
If people didn't have iPhones, this wouldn't have happened.
Would you recommend LastPass, rather than Bit Warden as a password manager?
Lol, this seems like a paid hit piece on Apple by Android, only Apple iPhones were stolen? 😂😂😂 The Wall Street Journal isn't credible anymore since having been purchased by Rupert Murdoch in 2007, it's a joke of a financial publication, and a running joke just like Fox News Corporation. 😂🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Good piece but was it necessary to have such a strong vocal fry on every single sentence?
In the book "Normal Accidents", Charles Perrow talks about the dangers of tightly coupled systems; one perturbation in the system can cascade and cause tremendous destruction. This story is an example of that phenomenon. Unfortunately, when IT organizations create products, they don't believe these sorts of safety issues could happen to them. Their idea and product will be so grand that it will solve all the world's problems, with no ill effects.  When these issues are raised within an organization, the typical response is to dismiss them as unlikely and unrealistic, then ignore or marginalize the person who raised it. This is delusional, and why I feel today's design practitioners are dangerous to society.
Well, this is a big issue that needs to be fixed, but they would be very disappointed when they got into my bank account, kinda how I feel when I see it 😢
You should be able to tie the phone/account to your person via an istore visit and provide the phone and an id. That’s it. If any issues occur, you can regain access to the account and dismiss all active logins….
New money glitch *NOT PATCHED *
I have not experienced a crime like this and Apples concept that their security measures are the best does obviously have major faults. For an Apple customer to loose access forever to their own stored items in iCloud
 is wrong. I personally do not trust anyone's cloud storage. I keep any thing I need to save on separate hard drive and backed up on additional drives. Not perfect but I believe this method breaks the access chain by eliminating online access.
Bank from phone ? Nuts. Bank at home on PC
I recommend 👆👆👆👆 he help me fix mine his work is 100%legit and trusted he is fast and reliable
Why are people not using face recognition to access their phones? User error.
Maybe don't highlight LastPass as a password manager…
Erm, why not use faceid??
It's very important that combined with Google account.
Lead a simpler life where you can do all your business at home.  My iPhone 13 mini is a bit wasted, I only bought it for the quality camera that I expect to still work in 20 years' time and to make calls.  Not connected to anything else, everything backed up to hard drives - no clouds, fogs or mists.  "Convenience" has been tried and doesn't work.
If you care then use Google Titan hardwaret key. It doesn't matter if the world gets your password to everything, they will never be able to access your account because you have the security key. This will protect everything.
Two factor
Apple can just rethink on the AppleID password change process.
Erm, this wouldn’t work today unless the phone is open. Who uses their passcode these days? There’s Face ID and Touch ID.
!
I have both Android phone and iPhone. I don’t trust either. I don’t use a passcode manager. I don’t use Apple Pay (least not yet). I don’t use cloud storage except as a backup for my calendar. The Android backs up the addresses on the apple and vise versa. Yes I manually copy one to another. My photos are stored on my Linux computer and backed up on an external hard drive.
To anyone watching this video who has seen Lastpass in it and decides that's the password manager they'll be using since it's shown in there; PLEASE DON'T for now. They were hacked not that long ago and some information was stolen. You might want to do your research on that. Honestly it's baffling that the WSJ in a report about passcode security would overlook such an important detail.
You MUST create a recovery key with iCloud. It should be thing A#1 that you do, immediately after signing up for an iCloud account. 

—Your Friendly Neighborhood IT&NetSec Professional
Why I'm not a crapple customer
lol this is more to do with social engineering ! No matter of Security can counter for human stupidity
1st thing don’t go to a bar and get smashed with strangers. Word !
3rd party password manager? Because those APPs are owned by really respectful  and trusty people who will never ever use your personal info including you passwords for anything other than good for mankind?
8:42 Don't use LastPass 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass#Security_incidents
Who's actually still typing in a passcode anymore?
Most of this could be avoided if Apple simply required you to enter the current password before allowing it to be changed. Too much is tied to the device passcode.
I’m deleting my bank app from my phone. If they get in at least they can’t get to my money
Just don't use iPhones. I know this sounds provocative. Apple really screws up with its clients.
Ummm are they using Face Id??? This sound suss.
Apple is full on bragging about their security and this happens smh
great vid
Im so glad im using android so this doesnt affect me.
Here’s a solution, Apple could do: Everyone that has an iPhone should have something that similar to like a metal business card or debit card that has an 800 number on the back where you can immediately lock your phone by calling the number using your email, Apple ID email, and phone number. The metal card should also have the serial number of your phone on it. There should be an option to completely lock the phone and or erase the phone. And that the phone can only be unlocked through Apple inside the Apple store.
What about with Face ID? Also android users are black Air Force type ppl. Better to be left alone. 😂😬 they’ll ask you for money instead.
People will hide their card pin but will enter their phones pin out in the open with full brightness and in sight lines of everyone
Bank passwords in xour password manager? You're beyond help. You're begging to be robbed.
Make crimes likes these especially harsh such as death penalty and magically over night these crimes would disappear.
This is the very reason the next iphone will cost a nail and a tooth 😂😂😂
Apple also recently made it possible to use Yubikey, in the latest iOS update. But it may not be convenient for the average user.
Well the only thing to the reporter here ... at the end you have shown "lastpass" as "Pwd_manager" -> weren't they hacked like on a big scale just recently ??? So ... i would even say ... do not store ANY important passwords (Bank, ID) but remember those few important ones ...and use 2FA always as well
my pro tip is to use a older model android phone, no thief will waste money monitoring you if you have a sub $200 phone
“I am a good Apple customer” just sounds so wrong. 
This just shows how wrong is to trust such a big part of one’s life to one company which tries, with all its 2+ trillion $ might, to prevent you from getting out of its walled garden.
The exact thing happened to me in London. £7000 stolen, couldnt login to apple for over 7 days as they couldnt help me. They kept saying our security is so strong we can let you recover the password without a 7 day waiting procedure.
Why pay so much for phone with face ID, fingerprint or other biometrics and not use it.  Seems an obvious solution 🤔
ThankYou!!!
People stop using your fking code in public if you can use Face ID or Touch ID
Great video, though I would not use Lastpass as an example of a third party password manager given the recent hack and the lack of security in their solution 😬
How about using Face ID? Also this is not only for Apple. Any other phone uses passcode
This problem never occur with fingerprint id. Face id is problematic & will force the user to put in the passcode instead eventually.
Everything in this story falls down to one thing: is people really still using 6 digits passcodes in their iPhones?
What about touchid sensor, since iPhone5s? What about Faceid?
Uhm…
Didn’t we have Face ID so we don’t manually type our password?
Rotten Apples 😄
Everything too connected, bad idea. Lose 1 thing, lose everything. And always do backup locally, 3 at least. 1 on device, 1 on cloud, 1 on local hard storage
Why is the unlock code the same as account unlock code. Should be different.
Ecosystem has its own benefit and harm.
I know this is going to happen one day with pin and patterns, but I thought applications require each their own password to prevent this from happening..
I have 4 active password that I can remember for internet activity. Gotta remember at least 3. And decouple - don't be lenient..
This is why I only use biometrics when I am outside. I returned my Google Pixel 7 because it's fingerprint sensor was awful, and I was forced to enter my passcode while out in public. Went back to use a Samsung instead.
Iphone passcode is for unlocking the iphone, icloud password is for anything about icloud or online services. Apple, which drunk engineer did you assign this job to?
Removing Touch ID is a bad idea
Biometrics. Problem solved.
Isnt that the purpose of face ID so that you dont need to login your passcode in public? This is more of ignorace by the user rather than apple protection.
I never save any passcodes. Just because I have trust issues with A I aka cyber hackers, robbers, thieves, etc. 😆 I’m older that’s way, maybe. Plus, I never bank with my phone. To weird. I like to walk in a bank and deal with a real person!
What about the new end to end encryption apple just released?
apple has some mickey mouse security
I am confused, you cannot change your Apple password nor disable find my iPhone without entering your apple account password. Just make sure you don’t have it stored on the apple keychain.
Android is not affected cos you need your google password in order to have access in all of these not like Apple that you just need 6 digit pass code
iCloud date of release is October 12, 2011. how have you just used it for 15 years? 🤣
Me panicking because of this video given I just bought an iPhone this month
In Malaysia, we have kill switch button for every banking apps. This provide instant blockade for any unauthorised banking transaction. This kill switch even block myself from transferring money.
Yes, this is a bug of Apple! Change Apple ID password should check old Apple ID password not the Apple passcode!
Apple could do one simple thing to greatly mitigate this problem: Require old iCloud password in addition to the passcode to change iCloud password. This way at least Find My cannot be easily disabled, and the owner can locate and erase the lost device. Apple's comment was insincere. Allowing change of iCloud password with a stolen device and passcode is not "multiple physical steps".
That’s why there’s Face ID
Even if they don’t see you put in your password, they can still brute force it and obtain your password if you don’t have it set to lock you out after enough failed password attempts, so make sure you have that turned on
Wow, really, you stored your banking details on your phone...and you wonder why you lost money. That's basic knowledge. You never store passwords. You could have called you bank and frozen your account as well ...
LastPass? Really? So much for security.
The real solution is using Face ID or using current apple ID passwords to verify identity before allowing changing apple ID password. There should be a choice of the 2, because There are far more people forget their old password, need to reset password than those with stolen phones. If you only ask old passwords before you can get new one then you lock out way more people out of their own accounts. Add using Face ID as a back up solving the issue. 

Of course now you will have to secure the change face ID part, which should need your Apple ID pass to turn off or change or delete the current Face ID in “FaceID & Passcode”
This is why I am not an Apple user. It's a closed ecosystem. Once a thief can get into your ecosystem it is over!
Thank you Joanna! Thank you WSJ. Great reporting!
Can we take a minute and recognize that this has happened to “99%” percent apple users because over half the country and most bar goers, gen z and millennials, 87% and 51% respectively have iPhones… that’s a clear reason as well not just value… it’s just what’s out there
If you get your phone stolen at a bar you must be really special
Thanks for sharing, but now everyone, up to no good, knows the process...
The 3rd party password managers have all been hacked recently. The best thing to do is just protect your password. None of the precautions work if they know the password.
3:38 Serious security flaw! Android for life!
For all this to happen, thieves need to know your passcode and by all means you should know now that your passcode is like your banking passcode , so first set your passcode something you can remember easily but same time complex and long or change to alphanumeric and second use face /touch id everywhere possible and if not then obivously you use your passcode but be careful in crowded places . Be safe out there.
Crickey, is she recommending Lastpass?
And  at 6:37min into the story she says the google OS (Android) can do the same. Hmmmm.
Anybody think the sgt look like mark ruffalo?
While I empathize with the victims, unfortunately it's the user's error and blaming Apple, or any other phone manufacture for that matter, for having your money stolen is unfair and simply wrong. The interviewee at least seems to think the fault lies with Apple, and not with the lack of self-awareness and common sense when handling the key to your entire life in a public space. I'm sorry to the oversensitive society, but not everything is idiot proof, harsh but true.
most newer android phones have a fingerprint reader and most banking apps require fingerprint verification to log in.
It seems like the obvious solution is to make it so the Apple ID password can’t be changed with the phone unlock code alone. Maybe require a separate code for that
Never have autocomplete credentials for banking logins.
Thanks for this reporting 🙏
Do one thing stop using Apple
For people on Android, instead of using the browser password manager, I'd recommend using something like Keepass instead.  With that, either a master key or fingerprint is required to log in.  All of the information can also be stored locally on your phone, completely offline if you want.
iCloud was launched in October, 2011 6:58
This is ridiculous. Almost all Apple users use fingerprint or facial ID to open their phone. Most people don’t use pass codes anymore.
lastpass got hacked
There ought to be a feature that automatically activates an ultra-secure state on the iPhone as soon as the user leaves their house, with the specifics of such security measures to be determined by Apple. Let's make this happen!
1.	Agree with the suggestions requiring a previous password! It’s easy and effective. …Why are people not getting this?  
2.	Accessing the ‘Wallet & Apple pay’ menu item should require the same biometrics as accessing ‘Passwords’.
3.	Allow users to decide what level of security they want across all the apps and functions.  Don’t make it all or nothing.  That will placate the people that can't remember their Apple IDs, etc.
4.	And if all else fails, Apple should be able to reset users' credentials provided the user can answer enough security questions, etc. You decide.
Here's how it'd go for Android / Google.. enter passcode > log out of the gmail account (that you can easily see) > try to log back in but hit fotgot password.. get an OTP ON THE SAME PHONE.. set a new password and change all the information of that account.

Once someone has access to your phone with it's passcode.. it's just game over.. which is why always use fingerprint or face unlock at any public place.
Hahahahahah go and buy overpriced apple products either. Apple fanboys are blind
It’s not an Apple specific problem. But here’s some additional tips:
Don’t treat your PIN like an ATM passcode. It is way more important.
Use 2FA apps (not text messages) wherever available, and use a separate password.
The best solution is to not have a digital life. 
Stop giving money to the enemies of humanity.
Apple is crazy, they ask us to create the crazy password for Apple ID, but can change by the passcode easily?! R Apple crazy?!
I only buy Samsung phone but I use MacBook Pros. I was so surprised at how easy it was to recover the Apple ID I always forget bc most of my life is in Google. Looks like 3rd party apps that require extra logins was the best suggestion I've seen for this. Also, I watch my phone like a hawk. I would lose my house keys before my phone.
Wow. I’m really glad I never set up Apple Pay on my phone. It’s insane there isn’t a way to verify your identity though. For that woman to lose access to her account is unforgivable.
I've got a Samsung GAlaxy A53 5G. I have a lock screen password. I have my banking app and credit card app. each has a different 5 digit passcode. You might get into my phone but you won't be able to change any passowrds or get into my banking and credit card app wich both need 2FA. Small tip. Store your passwords and passcodes in your head and not on keychain apps on your phone.
Hey you know what used to keep your phone safer? TOUCH ID. But no, they had to get rid of that.
Great short! 

It’s a good step forward in terms of people protecting themselves. Convenience comes at a cost.
Yet another reason to avoid iPhones.
Bring back Touch-iD
Step 1 don't buy a iPhone
Sloppy journalism- this video advocates LastPass password manager with an image at 8:44.  This has been hacked and is generally accepted to be extremely unsafe compared to other managers.  Mostly good news segment otherwise.
Why didn't she have Face ID activated
https://youtu.be/snAe9Ma-xbs Solution
Wow all of these comments! And not one person thought of the answer to this buy an Android! The one thing the Android does have going for it especially when a lot of the lower tiered phones is that they have a fingerprint reader That's something that Apple does not have! Most people that have Andrews that have fingerprint readers usually use the fingerprint reader so looking over the shoulder doesn't help you can say the same for Apple ID but most people are very comfortable with using the passcode more people than not on Android don't have this issue or they also have the ability to do a pattern which is hard to replicate! Android security for the everyday person is a little bit more tighter because it's so much more randomized!
Backup the backup!  Remember this;  1 is None and 2 is One.
I have a friend who travelled to another country and got some drug on his drink and got stolen his iPhone and suffered the same destiny: locked forever out of his Apple ID. I can’t simply understand how Apple can’t, at least, recover the id after the original customer complains. When we set it up, we have to write two secret questions and we may have other devices that help us verify their ownership, even geolocation. They have the tools to investigate, they simply don’t want to.
Changing the password with a passcode... what a joke. Android is superior.
Also you can print out Apple ID recovery codes
One of what you said is a bad tip.

One of the best thing Apple can do is, do not allow just passcode to able to enter any app, especially financial or important app.
It's already been said on your video. The passcode can be used to open other apps.
That shouldn't be the case, apple need some extra security.

Note
Passcode is not the same as password. The other one can only contain numbers.
Why wouldn't Apple at least offer the System-based option to erect a second DIFFERENT passcode gateway to anything involving personal or financial information? One for getting into iOS and another for conducting these additional moves? Since it would be entirely User-activated, that would allow it to involve the sort of choice that would shield Apple (and perhaps banks) from liability as well as please anyone who decries enforced behaviors from third-parties.
People’s stupidity isn’t Apple’s problem, rather the user’s problem. In this digital age one should consider every possible angle of attack and preempt it. The manufacturer of the the device shouldn’t be to blame because one’s indifference or lack of understanding/ knowledge
Por favor 
Pueden subtitular en español???????
Just lock sensitive app with extra password !
Use 1Password!  I have an alphanumeric 14 digit login for my Android device
I bet she's gone and bought another iPhone. Lol
Finally some valuable lessons from a youtube clip
Why she didn’t left her MagSafe wallet attached to her iPhone. It’s called privacy screen protector, Face ID & Touch ID and freeze all credit bureau your welcome
Or just set up your Apple pay with a secondary card where you send your money for online transactions, food, gas etc monthly, that way you will lose max 1-2k.
I can't believe you showed LastPass when talking about third party password managers, as if people should use them! They just had a massive breach, and it showed they were not encrypting everything! Shame on you. They had also not strengthened iterations (part of encryption) for long-term customers, another deplorable breach of trust.
I think it should just require you to send them your ID, or something like that. Anything else can be insecure.
Also, put a freeze on all your credit reporting account for additional protection so no one can create accounts even if they have your SS number!
The vocal fry is so annoying that I didn't finish watching the video
This just shows that fingerprints and Face Scanning is much more secure than Passcodes
I think the reasoning that they have this is because of the nature of 2FA. They want to ensure than when you log into Apple ID that you have both a password and access to a device that only you should have access to. With that, they then make the assumption that if you forget the Apple ID passcode you should be able to reset it using the physical device as well as the passcode that locks that physical device. Using biometric identification means that one person can't oversee you enter your password and thus it should be unlikely that even if they take your iPhone while unlocked that they are able to change details like you Apple ID password.
Not buying their toys will solve all your problems.
Just use a Google Pixel.😀 It's hard to bypass Android's security.😋 Waiting for the bombardment of 🐑😎
I used Apple alphanumerical so no one can guess
A couple suggestions she could have added. Settings > Password and Security > Account Recovery > and either add recovery contact or recovery keys
Its not the fault of the iphone passcode, maybe handle it like a pincode/password enter it in a way that u can obtain it by shoulder surfing.
If you opt in to end to end encryption now it’s available for iCloud even Apple can’t recover your data.  Resetting your password no matter what documentation or evidence you have is not an option.
Google ask you for you old password before changing even if you know the pin. So yeah, nice try.
For changing Apple ID password, why Apple don't use 2-step verification via email or other trusted Apple devices?
just buy Android. But you are stupid so you will still buy an iphone.
I use fingerprint unlock,  face unlock, and the last step pattern unlock - all this works seamlessly without thinking. And if you want to reset anything you still need a passcode.


P.S. I will buy too, if that dynamic island vanishes
Drunk New Yorkers blame Apple 😂
From the nudes leak, getting people's cameras and mics to turn on without them answering, to this... These are scary... Considering its a status symbol, Apple gotta take their customers more seriously instead of removing and selling stuff they removed
american people really think that apple is the best company in the world and I own apple products  😂😂😂😂😂
Why wasn’t she using biometric access? The solution is BIOMETRIC ID!
This is why I use a real password instead of a pin
Way to promote this shat WSJ
Another way is to use Apple Watch to unlock.
The title implies Apple is solely responsible for all of these people’s bad choices. People to this day use the same password for all accounts. Sorry, they have to know your passcode and steal your phone…. Also, what about Face ID or Touch ID… Sorry, this isn’t an Apple issue…. Also, some people were “drugged”?  How? More stupidity…
They should never know your passcode. Drinking, befriending a “stranger or anyone” and imputing your code in front of them. Most of these people are idiots of their own stupidity. Careless living your phone exposed… Pathetic.
Good thing I don't have an iPhone
Don't take your phone into a bar. Problem solved. I thought people went to bars to hook up. I guess the use case has changed. 
Oh and one more thing. Is banking on a handset you take everywhere a good idea? Probably not. 
Keep your memories in your head. That way you never lose them.
yep, this happen to my buddy, emptied his accounts, opened a credit card in his name. apple pay you name it. Apple has serious security flaws
I like how everyone is attacking Apple when it's the users fault for giving her passcode away. That's like giving someone your bank account password and then complaining that the bank didn't do anything to prevent their money from getting stolen.
Apple never should have scrapped the fingerprint scanner. I've had it embedded within my Samsung screen since 2020. No Face ID? No problem.
Why aren't these people using Face ID instead of passcodes?
You can lock such settings behind your password instead but people don't take an interest in their own security. I can't tell you how many times I've seen people's pins over the years. Not only that but nothing is diversified. Use a password manager that's not tied to the phone company. Use a backup solution that's not icloud. Create layers of defense.
@apple
I think if apple add these two layers of security, none of these things would happen.
1: Additional password for Apple ID or Old password prompt.
2: Master password for password manager it self;
If she used Touch ID or Face ID this problem wouldn’t have happened, no?
It’s RIDICULOUS how you just glossed over the need to enable Face ID!!!!! That is huge!!!! That would have stopped all of this from happening.
Oh and Joanna do I have a story for you…
so basically keep your PIN private? That's the security tip?
I don’t understand why this woman has filed a criminal complaint and is on YouTube discussing her account being stolen and apple wont help her get back into her account and is siding with the thieves here? I mean essentially they can even track the thieves down. Secondly why can’t the phone company help. Can’t she get the same number and text the password there or my guess is they changed the icloud email altogether?
Even the thieves also know Apple Product users are rich 💁‍♂️
I saw some quick fix using Screen Time. Unfortunately, using Screen Time as a fix DOES NOT WORK. They just need to go to Screen Time, Change Screen Time Passcode, Turn Off Screen Time Passcode, Forgot Passcode, enter your Apple ID (which they could have guessed by fiddling with your phone, such as your email accounts), Forgot Apple ID or Passcode, then wait a bit, there will be an option to reset Apple ID via the lock screen passcode again. 

So far, there’s no fix to prevent malicious access and control to our full account once the lock code is compromised. We need more of us to voice out, and get our voices heard by Apple.
Something very similar happened to me on my Instagram account. Losing 10+ years of memories and contacts is definitely a challenge to overcome.
The whole video can be countered with just 2 words.  Face ID.  Nobody uses the passcode no more not even the old phones that don’t have Face ID. These problems have been solved with the integration of Face ID.
I'm not sure if something similar exists on iOS or stock Android, but on Galaxy phones (One UI) you can set up Secure Folder, which creates something similar to a separate partition on your phone for apps, photos, videos, docs, calendar, contacts, notes, etc., all secured by Knox and it includes its own Play Store and Galaxy Store. I bet a lot of Galaxy owners don't even know about or use this feature and I was one of them. That's where all my financial apps exist. You can than "mask" the icon for Secure Folder by changing the name and icon to something generic and inconspicuous. If a thief can still find it, the passcode is different from my phone passcode (which I never use anyway because I use either touch or face unlock). If the thief can somehow crack that, the financial apps require fingerprint unlock or the unique passwords I've set up for each one. If the thief can somehow crack all that, then maybe they deserve every penny they can steal from me lol.
That is why you should hide your phone screen while entering your passcode if you have to and also, use biometrics rather than passcode in public!
They should provide app lock with face id so we can lock bank apps
Not here to blame the victim. It’s definitely the people who commit crimes should be punished.

Yet, people knows how to not put all the eggs in one basket when it comes to investments… why would it possibly sound like a good idea to save everything with one service?

There are a lot of apps out there that is cheaper and better than iCloud’s offering like Google Photos, Spotify, Telegram(or signal) just to name a few.

If your iCloud is locked, at least your memories are save if you’re on Google Photos / Drive.

Or… just follow the best practices of backing up files - an on-site backup + an online cloud backup.

It’s lots of work but if it’s that valuable to you it must worth the hassle.
Am I the only person that uses Face ID!?
She needs to stay home
I never understood, coming from many years on Android phones, why Apple doesn't have a fingerprint reader in the power button. It's so annoying when FacID fails and I have to enter my Passcode. Apart from that, thieves are targeting IPhones because we all know wealthy people made Apple their brand of choice. I doubt smart thieves like these would take the risk reselling IPhones after taking thousand of dollars out of their victims.
This isn't an Apple iPhone Passcode problem, this is a stupid careless user problem.   The thieves have to learn the passcode by watching you enter it?   Seriously?
This happened in Mexico and Brazil. What a shame
This is why I still keep my iPhone with Touch ID.
Settings-Screen Time- Passcode to setup a screen time passcode /PIN

Then Content and Privacy Restrictions- Account Changes -Don’t Allow

Now in order to change ur Apple ID password someone also needs ur screen time pin.
You can also reset ur Apple ID password with ur email tho… lol
6:15 Because we mostly use literally our finger print and even if we had to type our password it's not numerical only, we can use a paswordlike: Hello_Mybruh2045, which is magnitudes of time more difficult to "see" while you're typing over the shoulder.
I promise dude, even my friend once just saw his girl use the passcode and literally went all over her phone to stalk LOL. 🤣🤣
Just use a 10 to 20 digit password with about 80% letters and you'll be fine.
Awesome reporting
i got locked out of my icloud too. apple didn’t help. wouldn’t help. nor cared.
This society is not worthy of mobile phones lol... Btw, why are people manually entering passcodes, when you have fingerprint readers? I'd never enter my phone's passcode in public.
Really Joanna? LastPass?
This is not an Apple issue. This is a users issue. Why are they using the password when iphones have face ID? Plus why are they using the 6 digit code when you can make a harder passcodes. People are lazy when it comes to the safety of their devices.
Come back touch ID
Why didn’t she use Face ID instead of a passcode? 🤔
That's why you never login with your main AppleID on your phone...use local account only when outside. Then wherever you need to use your AppleID then login and out when you're done. It is the safest way without compromising your privacy.
Wouldn’t having FaceID as an additional verification requirement fix majority of the concerns?  After all it is unlikely we will lose/forget our face.
This doesn't sound like it's Apple's fault? They're not exactly doing anything technically complex, just social engineering. 1) Befriend, 2) see you enter your passcode (idk why you wouldnt use face ID instead?), 3) then steal and execute info from 2) ...
If somebody set the recovery phone number to the same that is in use in the iphone is obvious that would get easy to get your phone unlocked
sometimes it is not all about money, it also about that apple phone can't be unlocked like android so those who steal people a showing apple company that it is possible
Android 💪💪
What happened to  face ID?
If people where not so dumb. This wouldnt be happening. Dont use the password save option on phones. Dont put any sensitive information on any phones. KEEP YOUR PRIVATE, SENSITIVE PASSWORDS DIFFERENT FROM ACCOUNT TO ACCOUNT
All Apple has to do is to add fingerprint reader as well.
Biometrics has been on Apple for a minute why she did not have it turned on?
Crazy wild idea, what about just using fingerprint? I rarely ever use pin code.
Question #1

How did they get the code?

Question #2

Did you have 10 try of passcode turned on or it will delete?

Question #3

Apple has E2E encryption for advanced data protection, was that turned on?

These simple features can save your account.
The statement @ 0:57 Am a good Apple customer does not mean too much to Apple at all.

Not trying to bash, but that does not mean nothing when it comes to Security.
Presuming they were able to log in to her bank account using the iPhone password, that indicates she had Face ID enabled (to get into her online banking, and presumably to unlock the iPhone)
Why was she typing in her password at a bar?
Why not Face ID? (To unlock her phone)
Of course, it might require you type your password when it’s timed out or too many failed attempts, but in those situations, which are super rare (in my experience) I always make sure my surroundings are as clear as possible and that no one is lurking…
It’s weird when I rest my iPhone it wouldn’t let me set it up without my old Apple ID and if you have Face ID you don’t really need your
Pin and cover your phone if you do use a pin I’m not saying this ain’t possible still but every time I reset my phone it’s asked for my old one
Why didn’t she just use Find my iPhone?
Don’t make an easy passcode, set it up to automatically wipe after consecutive wrong passcode entry.
Why not use Face ID?
Use Face ID next time.
Face ID and fingerprints have their own vulnerability.
Drunk or passed out, the thef can still get in.
However it's an additional layer
So apple doesn’t have extra steps? Aside from the passcode? Lol. 

I feel bad for the victims. But apple needs to do better especially when they are charging over a 1000 dollars for a phone when compared to android who has far better security measures at sub 200 dollar’s.
Simple fix would be to require your current password to change your password.
The simple fix for this would be for Apple to require a Fido key or 2FA to change the passcode. With users not sending the 2FA to an email that’s accessible via the phone. All 3 of your steps are valid also. My family says the military made me paranoid when it comes to security but this just proves my point.
Bro heard of privacy screen protectors? Jus use em. People wnt be able to snoop into your passcode that easily.
Megabummer…  The first thing I do when I get a new device is to set the “passcode” to a monster-long, upper-/lower-case alphanumeric, full-blown password.

Of course, I normally use biometrics to log into it, so having to type in a monster password is rare, but yes, it’s a pain when I do have to.

When I do have to type in my passcode (iPhone password) in a public place, I keep it close to my chest, and I type in part of it, turn 90 degrees around, type in a little more, turn 90 degrees again, type in more, etc., so that it’s vastly more difficult for “shoulder surfers” to see my whole password.

My biggest vulnerability is the passcode on my Apple Watch, but I immediately changed that to waaay longer than the default 4 digits.
So just use Face ID or finger ID AND IF SOMEONE WALKS UP JUST BE ALERT and don’t use passcode keep it old fashion password for everything
So their wrong, to access passwords and encrypted notes you need to use biometric (it won’t let u use passcode even if you cover up camera or don’t  Touch ID etc).

Update: even if the thief goes into your pass code options and disables Face ID for passwords, it won’t let you use the pass code
1:23 how is that possible with double authentication that means that they would have to have access to both oh your email is also connected so they’re looking in your email inbox or you get the text message from your phone
old school folks are having a field day.
Really interesting
Shouldn't have been drinking
This is her fault. Why would you banking password info. Manually input it yourself
Pen and paper is still available folks..
Just as much as we’ve found out just how vulnerable we can be many have also by watching this video found out how to exploit. Bittersweet result
Apple security is a joke. How can someone change your password without the password!
Use your mobile phone as a mobile phone, nothing else, and you won't experience any of these problems. People have their entire lives on their phones, what could possibly go wrong?......
Do iphones have fingerprint unlock?
IPhone users need to stop relying on simple four-digit numeric passcodes that can be easily observed by others, and use complicated, lengthy alpha-numeric + special character/pass codes.
Yes you have a point. But all I heard was Apple Apple Apple for 8:95 minutes and 5 seconds about android. You made it would like it’s an Apple problem. It’s not and you said it your self in those slim 5 seconds. Enable the erase all content from phone if the password input was wrong 10 times. And use your Face ID or Touch ID. If you are at a bar or casually giving out your password then yes you got what you deserved. This only can happen if you are careless. 

Said that, yes the company should change a bit the impact that password has on your phone by not making it so easy for someone to gain that kind of access with your phone password.
Better protection exist: in a Samsung (with Knox) phone...
Ever heard of Face ID instead for logging in instead of typing in your passcode?
The simple answer is disable password on the iPhone and only use Touch ID or Face ID and set it for the shortest time possible to lock it when not being actively used.

I don’t see how anyone can access info on your phone if those functions are active, it also protects passwords for more sensitive apps where you have to input a password and don’t use those in public.
Maybe you should stop buying iphones 🤔
I think most people steal iPhones because most people use iPhones
6:57 “I’ve been using iCloud for 15 years”, but iCloud started in 2011.
Police use cctv to help find PIN numbers. Always shield your hand!
I like Samsung it has a completely different password for the account and a different one for the phone. So one password cannot be missused.
You cant fix the problem with a technical solution. If it were possible, it would be done. When a mobile device gets that much authority, its a set up for failure.  The problem is at the architectural level and its called over-reach.  

Apple does not care if people are can be hacked and lose everything. Their business model is more important. Dont buy into the so called "tech company" BS. Big tech cant make it work, they cant make it hack proof. If they could it would be done.  We are about 2 decades into this now, and its gradually occurring to people that most of it is profit centered and not about people or improving the world.

And you cant look at any one situation and think its isolated. Its all the same problem.  Big Tech overreach and a profit centered Business model.
Apple Rulez in terms of security lololol
They could solve this by only allowing users to change their Apple ID using Face ID with the Apple ID password / traditional password recovery as the fallback instead of the iPhone passcode.
That statement "I'm a good Apple customer and I backup everything to the cloud" is so dumb. you being a loyal customer is actually confirms a regular cash flow for the company.
but why are people not using Touch ID or Face ID?
you can now use a physical nfc key to unlock your icloud, which is more secure. just don't lose the key haha
Dont save your passwords on keychain lol
...and this is one of the many reasons why I'll never switch to iOS.
LASTPASS??? Really??? Does WSJ read the news???🤔🫤
Must be really slow at the WSJ offices… This is the entire reason why biometrics (faceID, fingerprints) are used. How often does this happen WSJ? Surely, you’re not making a mound out of a molehill with clickbait headlines just for the sake of views? You all must have some integrity? Right?
A simple date of birth + passcode to reset appleid would eliminate 99% of this problem! 
1. The thieves would need to know your dob too 
2. You would never forget your dob so remembering it won’t be a problem!
You’re welcome Apple!
Shame on Apple. Imagining its proud marketing of 'security' is just sarcasm. Aren't security mechanisms meant to withstand even under rare circumstances? And shoulder surfings are actually not rare. So what did the Apple spokeswoman mean by 'rare'? She was not only neglecting customers' losses and even mocking them for not adopting Face ID 🤬🤬🤬
A Recovery Key and a proper protected 2FA (not the one provided by Apple with iOS PIN), should be mandatory for changing the Apple ID password. However, Apple Passwords should be treated more seriously by Apple. By design it is difficult to be accessed and use by user as everyday pass manager, but easy to be hacked  by anyone with the iPhone’s pin. Lack of security and features.
iOS passwords should be protected in the same way as Apple’s  User Profile - which is double protected by Apple Password and triple protected in Screen Time with another pin as example. The fact that Apple doesn’t aloud to unlock your account with your ID verification, billing, or the police help is another Apple none sense. 
PS never relay on biometrics when it comes to sensitive datas. Unlocking iPhones with biometrics should be a different than  sensitive informations and Apple’s account.
There is one thing worth making ultimately clear:
If one is negligent with protecting their pin, you‘re f*cked.
The pin is the ultimate number - avoid using it in public.
I feel very comfortable with touch-id or face-id, it is very secure.
Everybody ‚kinda‘ knows this from his debit/cash/ATM-card: protect your pin!
But in a bar…“sure, no prob, I‘ll just type it in…“ .
It is still users fault, even if the phone vendors could and should drastically improve this easiness on their end.

That being said, there are times when the „comfortable and secure way“ of touch-id and face-id don‘t work - and that is a problem (as well).
I always felt watched (maybe my paranoia helped me) during covid and doing purchases with mask on: how often had I to use my passcode because face-id was not applicable.
so you're telling me this people used the passcode instead of using FaceID?
Seriously you are talking about protection and security and when you recomend password manages the most prominent one you display is LastPass? The one that had suffered at least 3 super big leaks in past 5 years?
Apple is ridiculous
Face ID should scan whenever passcode reset is requested. It's that simple. That way the phone actually knows who's trying to reset the passcode.
One immediate solution is for Apple to deploy an update in which the Change Passcode setting requires a different passcode than the one to unlock your screen. To protect from users login to apps, use a third party aop, Bitwarden is a good free personal choice. Never store pictures of your ids, taxes, ssn on any photo album. Use a third party app fir photos like amazon or google, you might still be vulnerable but perhaps with a multiple email account register you might becable to recover. I download my pics to laptop then to external usb and connect them to tv as screen saver while listen to music. A lot more work, but at least i get to see pictures most  often. Apple is very secure, but to keep it simple, they only  use one key 🔑 to unlock everything, this is why an immediate solution is to have a different passcode to unlock the change your passcode feature.
So the simple solution is to Add the current password field at the time of changing password.
So no face id?
buy 2 physical security keys ios 16 🔑
Stop blaming Apple iOS when :
1. You can use Touch ID or Face ID to unlock in public 
2. When you can use different password or biometrics for your bank apps

Blame on the stupidity of the users
You will not fix the problem - thru settings or easy solutions. Settings will change or become not a solution. How? An updated OS can change them. You might change them accidentally. Or a crook can find a work around. When a phone becomes vulnerable, you will not know it. 

How did Apple not anticipate that a crook could just watch you enter your pass code? Some how they didn't, they thought it was safe and made the entire OS reliant on a pass code. 

So the phone can use face ID? But that can fail if your appearance changes, if you wear a hat, or if there is confusing noise. Fingerprint sensor? wont work if you hands are wet or dirty.

Technical work arounds go to infinity - and crooks just find new ways to counter them because - crime pays.
Rule number 1: Never use any kind of password managers....keep your memory sharp instead
Move to Google or Samsung
Apple resetting passwords just by entering the phone's pass code is just plain dumb.
Switch to Samsung Knox people. Wayyy better
It’s baffling how there is no app lock in ios. Not even third party app lockers are allowed. In my android I have native app lock for most of my social media and banking apps which uses different authentication than my phone lock. I can’t do any of those in my iPhone. Everything is easily exposed if you have the 6 digits
Replace the off button with a fingerprint censor. Simple.
Thankfully, I'm not of the generation that puts their entire lives into their phone; a thief stealing my phone would get just that.. the phone, as I don't use my phone for banking or apps or making payments, just calls; crazy right? only using a phone to make phone calls.. I must be nutzzz.
The real issue is the way the thieves even get the passcode in the first place is cuz they don’t have to see exactly what you press but where cuz the numbers are always in the same spot. I’m proposing the option to scramble the digits every time you re input the passcode so no matter where you touch unless the thieves can actually see your screen they don’t know what you pressed which vastly improves security especially for a device that’s used exclusively for the passcode like a electronic keypad for a front door or any system or room that can be dusted to see which keys are touched
dont use apple keychain use third party password manager
Why are these people entering their pass odes instead of using faceID? Sure sometimes you get locked out but let’s be smart people…
If the Face ID system is that trustworthy, we should ONLY be able to enter every app with Face ID. Leave the password for unlocking the iPhone but if you don’t have your face then you can’t use the apps that requires your face to do it. It’s simple and it’s the way most of the people use their iPhone anyways. 

We should eliminate the password system from the equation. 

And yes, if you want to change your Apple ID password the you should enter the current one, not just the password of the phone 😅.
I don’t understand if I can prove I am the person whose account that belongs to why can’t Apple allow me to reset the security
Users suppose to have some responsibility or understanding with your phone. It can happen or not happen depending on the users.
There are 2 incredibly easy steps Apple can do to stop this:
1. Require the old Apple I.D. password to be entered when creating a new one.
or...
2. Require Face I.D. on newer iPhones when accessing your Apple I.D. and requiring Touch I.D. on older iPhones when accessing your Apple I.D.
So how to protect yourself.
An Excellent Report, Tnku, 27.02.2023.
Fingerprint?
Maybe don’t go to bars?
This is why I don't have apple products. Thier security is just horrible! I quit using apple after the celebrity nude leaks from icloud brute force hacks because apple at the time didn't have a wrong password lockout.
Omg thanks for keeping us safe Joanne! You literally unlock a new fear! I lost my iphone 6s plus  in a train ride, luckly my data is not touched by them, 
But hardware wise i lost an good phone.  The main thing Thieves using is to switch off my phone, Apple  needs to prevent it by adding a  screen time password  to that as well.
are they using the same code for everything???
You do realize, that you‘re giving potential thieves a step-by-step tutorial, right?
I don’t know why their first step isn’t to call the mobile carrier and suspend the phone line.
Please forgive me I don’t mean to sound insensitive but why are people typing in a passcode that people can see instead of using biometrics? It’s far more difficult for a thief if he doesn’t know the passcode/password.
I think Apple already fixed this problem with physical security keys in the latest iOS update.
Thieve also do this by saying they need to make an emergency call. You hand them an unlocked phone and they CashApp themselves money
The fact that you can't physically show up somewhere with your government issued photo ID and get your account recovered is strange.
Why not either verify the old Apple ID passcode, or use the iTunes passcode to allow these changes?
Facial recognition. DUH!
Why don’t u just use Face ID/ Touch ID like ur suppose to
Apple scamming their customers yet they buy every iPhone every year lol
Good apple customer!!
Comedy of the century
thats why i never had and will have an iphone:)
apple has massive logical flaws in their security that i tried to write them about to no vail, not being from america made it insanely difficult too, but their safety check feature in the privacy and security section is a mistake and a disaster for a tech company, it allows you to bypass any other settings that could prevent a password reset and just reset the password as you wish if you know the passcode, making screen time restrictions absolutely useless, i tried to write to them multiple times and just gave up when update after update the issue was still there
Funny how they call it a vulnerability. The careless user is the vulnerability not iOS.
People should stop using passcodes. Face is a better choice
Why was she using her pin and not Face ID ? This could happened to to someone using android also. It’s not an iPhone problem.
My goodness, thats why i have different pw for my financial accounts 🥺 never i link my cards or bank acc with iphone or with same pw. Apple eliminating the finger print really annoying too.
I know it seems convenient to have everything connected and easy to log in, but that's exactly why it's so much more dangerous if you get compromised. 
No security system is perfect, so why put all your eggs in one basket?
Use separate and longer passwords for your most important accounts. Stop using SMS for 2FA. Put limits on how much money you can use in a day on your accounts. Stop using so many different cash apps.
Dontou really need photos of your passport and social security? If so, erase them as soon as the task you need them for is completed.
When you have on you a mini ATM loaded with thousands of dollars better do not go with it in  a bar full of strangers and play with it as its just a cute little social media toy full of emoticons. Just saying.
Real problem here is that Apple needs to bring back TouchID, FaceID fails at a bar at night.
She should have used 'Bitwarden' that built-in Apple Password Manager seems to easy to get in.
Or just get an Android phone.
This is what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket.
This video highlights a major issue that many iPhone users may not be aware of. It's scary to think that someone can ruin your entire digital life in just a few minutes if they gain access to your phone.
Apple definitely needs to change the password change process. That would literally nail this on the head. Additionally, for other people, cloud backup IS NOT A BACKUP SOLUTION! You should also have an additional physical copy of your data at the very least if you really truly care about your data. You can't rely on convenience to save you.
I seldom use passcode, I usually use biometric or fingerprint to unlock my phone.. i have no bank apps, email app usually logout, and memorized my mobile number, so I can immediately call may service provider to cutoff my line so that security codes would not be sent on my number.. oops.. sorry my phone runs on Android..
They don’t like to use Face ID?
Why she didn’t lock her accounts or atleast change your bank account passwords and doesn’t she have access to her original email to reset her account password 😂 if some steal my phone my password 123456 and i aint gon change it 🤣🤣🤣
People have too much passwords save ...we not using our brains anymore ...everything is save for us ..smh that's part of the dam problem
That's why you don't do your financial stuff on your phone, I knew this type of stuff will eventually happen.
They should probably do some type of dual authentication
Why wouldnt you use biometric
Wow, this is wild, definitely woke me up about how I use my phone in public. And the fact I still use a 4 digit passcode in public places
1. I always provide my bank account password all the time. It is not saved. 
2. Always delete photos with sensitive information after use. 

The problem with bank account is that even when you do not store the password the thief can always call your bank and change password cause the authorisation is via SMS.
I put my iPhone’s passcode in like 5 times a week.  Face ID
1. Use biometric access. 2. Use a second phone when going out. 3. If password is required for anything, do it under the table. 4. Use a different apple account. 5. Dont use media backup like onedrive.  Same can be done for Android users. Lastly, why would you take your bank and your entire online life with you to a bar? People are just to naive.
Or just don’t let thieves steal your passcode and your phone 🤦🏻‍♂️
Wait, there are people that don't treat their phone's passcode like an ATM pin? I'm blown away by this! I use fingerprint in public or check over my shoulder before inputting a passcode.
What’d you expect from a slave labor company?
Great Job!
It is funny that in this video, when they suggest rethinking the password manager, they show LastPass.
or maybe people should stop needing money to get essentials.
Whats wrong with her accent? Lol
Thanks for this video. I hope they come up with better ways to protect the access
Some of my take aways are : 

- Apple Pay convenience isn’t worth the risk
- use another cloud for photos and important docs
And you need a sort of long term unlocking with some sort of offline verification
Call the banks and credit card companies immediately?
What about using 2factor authentication to unlock your iPhone. Did you look into whether that would prevent this theft? Can an Apple Air tag somewhere on  your person prevent this problem? Can we set AirTag as 2nd factor then If the thief gets the iphone, but not the Air Tag will this prevent them unlocking the phone and doing the rest?
Terrifying
The Apple ID breaking should require 2 factor in a different device or email . 
Ah wait , email could be on the phone
This is one reason I bought a NAS and keep all my photos on  there, I rarely use iCloud.  yes iit is still a risk but for Apple to lock everything up is sad.
fear mongering to sell third party services. brilliant.
Android allows you to change your password only if you enter your current password, NOT with your passcode.
You can change your code to a 4 digit instead of 6. A lot of people fail to see that and use that feature
whats the purpose of face unlock?
my phone got stolen late last years but luckily no one know my pattern so I was safe
Just received my first Apple phishing text message. Happy to join this elite list 😅
In the EU there's 3D secure which requires all online transactions to be double-checked through face or fingerprint ID.
I don't recommend LastPass as a password manager
What they could do is add an extra code, one for your phone and one for sensitive apps. 

Like a safe code, a vault always comes with key in case you lose your code. This is what Apple should do. Also you have a recovery password for iCloud.
Bruh use Face ID. Who uses passcode when you have Face ID (iPhone X (10) and up
I always hold the phone close to my chest if I have to enter my passcode. 

But a crowded bar is the last place I would do that in. Heck, I wouldn’t even go in one until government takes crime seriously again

But there should be multiple factors of authentication for changing the iCloud password. More than two. 

I’d like to be able define 6 methods of authentication, require two for getting into the phone, 4 for changing the password. 

And some of those authentication methods should include calling a sibling or trusted friend. Or using a notary public. Things that might be slow but are doable. 

Answering security questions, making a phone call or talking to an AI via Facetime could be authentication methods.

But don’t unlock your phone in a crowd of potential predators.
It looked like a reasonable explanation until the end of the video. But when I saw the end, I asked, Is this a LastPass ad? which company admits that almost every month passwords are stolen by hackers. ohh god.
I've been using the fingerprint sensor on my Android phone for years for this very reason.  Makes me uncomfortable entering my PIN code in public.
Or just stay at home
Require the old Apple ID password to change to a new one. If it is entered via keychain or the like, require the 24-hour waiting period that Apple themselves implement in some instances.
I aslo password protect several photo albums on my phone.
What about account recovery and recovery contacts? It allows you to get your data back even if locked out.
I added this:  At least one a year, I download all my photos to my local hard drive.
No FaceID? No screen fingerprint?
This happened to me, I've heard it happen to many people.
The problem is a bad one. And some of the suggested remedies are worse, if not, equally bad!
Android don't have this problem because they actually let you choose options to unlock like fingerprint. Which Apple could also put under the screen or power button.
Apple costumer service is horrible there advise is just buy a new Apple.
My I phone 13 pro after update , it’s networking card got burnt
What.... iPhones don't use a fingerprint sensor instead of code like a Samsung? Have to replicate my fingerprint before I lock it, track you and delete data.
Once your phone is opened, and you go to settings and go to passwords, and it is showing the passwords for everything, your bank, Apple Pay, PayPal, etc or anything, it shows just dots, if you just touch the dots it shows your password, so delete those passwords completely, and write them down somewhere else in your house or in your safe if you can’t remember them, so if your phone gets taken and your initial password is compromised, your bank passwords will not be in there so they can’t get into your account without knowing your passwords.
I can't get into the keychain password manager, using only the 6 digit passcode, at least in the latest ios. It requires face id. This means theives can't access your banking apps
My passcode has been an entire sentence for the past few years, it’s annoying but I can enter my passcode in front of anyone because you’d have to be recording to catch it. My friends say I’m crazy but hey, I’ve always said if you’re going to get hold of my phone you won’t be able to use it at all cause ain’t no guessing this passcode.
This is a dumb story. Ugh. Like lessen the issues of someone’s telling your wallet or keys. Yeah, it’s the wallet maker fault…dumb
Yall making a bgi deal out of nothing. Create a secure password. With Face ID, theres nothing to type in for a theif to snoop. It starts and ends there.
Laughs in samsung
You should thank that thief to break you out of Apple prison
I guess this is one major reason why I love Android and back everything I need up on a 1T backup drive I keep in my safe.  Even if someone got into my phone, nothing is connected on Android.  Everyting in Apple is run through Apple's system.  You can also get great deals on Android phones.
Just pay attention to your surroundings! They also make security keys for iphones that prevent this. They would have to take the key along with the iphone!
just use android
why apple dont just remove the requirement for passcode and use face id for everything
Man goes to the hospital because he is missing his thumbs. When asked what happened, he said "I use Apple Touch ID on my phone which was snatched from me."
There are ways to protect yourself, but people want speed and simplicity so users don't want to jump through hoops. Security options are not the issue; the user often is.
If my phone is stolen, the thief wasted his time. Unless he wants to play my Angry Birds and better my score.
I may be dumb but help me understand why would people enter their passcode, instead of using their Face ID/ Touch ID?
The problem with Apple is it gives it's customers fake sense of security and that leads to users being careless.
Need jailbreak for iOS 16 please.  EQE is the best app
ahh...u let other people's look at your passcode...
LastPass?

Where have you been?
HAHAHHAHA CRAPPLE IJUNK
Thank you for reminding me!
I will be offloading the PII (Personally Identifiable Information) of over 10k convicted thugs and thieves today.
I have names, addresses, SS info, contact info, personal photos (from hacked iCloud / Google accounts), tax records and other highly sensitive and personal data belonging to convicted thugs, thieves, rapists and pedophiles on my computer and Synology NAS.

I will be sending this info to about a dozen scam bosses in Nigeria and India, hackers in N Korea and Russia and anyone else who wants it.

Maybe when these scumbag thieves, rapists and pedophiles become the #1 target and victim of hacking, scams, identity takeovers, 'tactical hunting events' and other LAWFUL activities, they will stop being scumbags.

Since these scumbags are in trouble with the law, during an IRS scam call, when they are threatened with arrest / blackmailed, they WILL panic and lose all logical thinking abilities and fall for the scam.
I've got a personal connection into one of the biggest scam call centers in India and the guy sent me 10 call recordings of scammers successfully scamming convicted thugs and rapists. 9 out of 10 of the calls, when the scammer threatened the scumbag with arrest / SWAT showing up at their address, they panicked and gave their bank info and SS number without further question. So this proves that thugs and predators are the most vulnerable class of people when it comes to scams.
Its a bad world. Just vicious.
LastPass though ;)
IN A SELF INTEREST SYSTEM YOU WILL NEVER HAVE PRIVACY.
I would avoid lastpass, they just had a breach and were able to get personal data on many account holders.
Saying Android has the same 4-6 pin passcode is a gross oversimplification and misleading. On Android you have patterns and you can set actual full length alphanumericcharacter passwords. Someone would have to be hovering over your shoulder recording you to get your pattern or multicharacter password.
What you need is to set up security using security key then when they go to change the password to your account it will ask for the security key and they don’t have it and won’t be able to change it.
I don’t trust 3 rd party either
You can't change your password by having the passcode on Android, you need to enter the old one, besides android users usually use patterns and not passcode to secure the phone and they are way more difficult to memorize.
If Apple gave an option to use a special passcode to change Apple ID or turn off find my phone that would solve a huge portion of these issues. User can go to password manager, using unique password to retrieve the special code.
Don't use mobile devices or regular desktop to access banks or any financial institutions. Instead, use a chrome book for all your banking. Yes password manager with a strong and unique postcode is important also. Not a big fan of browser based password managers.
Come On This Drunk Chick Is To Blame When Cellular Phones Came Out Never Let Someone See Your PASSWORD OR PASSCODE At All Costs
Don’t act like you are innocent for your stupidity.  Protect your passcode like your life is depend on it!! Cover your your hands. 

If you go to bars and clubs or wherever, put the phone away and have fun!!!
Apple in the title means more clicks, as if this an Apple only problem. A more accurate title would be: “passwords are not perfect security”. Did you ever heard of ATMs? Same thing: people can watch you enter your code and then still your card or they can just force you to withdraw money.
This is what your Face ID and fingerprint ID are for. They’re not just fancy tricks.
Just don’t take at hand your iphones when you are out at night and drunk people😅
Interesting but the US is way way behind in bank security - all my German banking apps require a secondary password to send money - one that isn't saved on the device! 😮
Recommending Last Pass is a miss step considering how many times they have been hacked...that we know of.
Someone steals the keys to your car. They can then unlock your car and drive it away. You then blame the manufacturer of the car for making it too easy for someone with the keys to steal your car. That is what I see happening here. Someone watched you enter your passcode and then stole your phone. I don't understand how it is the manufacturer's fault. A solution for this exists, if you use Screentime. In the Content and Privacy restrictions section, you can choose to not allow changes to the Passcode and Account. Of course, it will be Apple's fault for not making these settings clear, even though they are built in.
One suggestion was to use FACE ID instead of password in public BUT, there were multiple incidents in NYC over past 4years where gay men were drugged in clubs by organized thieves. They would use victim’s face to unlock phones and then steal everything and do banking transactions. NYPD came out and told people to DISABLE Face ID when in clubs.
Although I feel for the people that lost their money, something doesn't add up because when I go into settings, and click on my apple ID, it ask me right away for my Apple ID password, not my phone's password. Also to change my Apple ID password, I'm prompted to answer 3 questions. Then I'm able to change my password. Next, most of my banking apps will ask me to log in again if they noticed that I changed the phone's password or modified face ID in any way, like the time when adding a mask. When I added a mask to my face ID most of my banking apps prompted me for my banking password. 

I think there's more to this story that they're not telling us.
Did not even know 6 digit passcode is even allowed now, which initially annoyed me, but I guess now I should be glad.
Apple doesn’t even give a flying F#@k about all this they are just busy saving environment by maximising Profits and minimising innovation and cutting down on costs 😂
My Apple Watch has helped me in these situations especially since I switched to the cellular version
Now I see why Apple is heavily thinking of getting rid of the Password/Passcode for Face ID & Touch ID
Please don’t recommend LastPass.
Other apps should implement their own passcode mechanisms and not rely on the iPhones password. Also I was really shocked when I found out I could change my iCloud password with just my iPhone passcode. When you have the passcode you can essentially access everything on someone else’s phone since most of the authentication mechanisms fallback on that.
Thanks a lot.. i just remove my bank card from apple pay ..old fashioned cash payment is ok
Apple should sue Wall Street Journal for doing this.
tehe
The guy doesn't know why it's only iPhone. Because iPhones have more values than android😱😱😱. If Iphone has under the display fingerprints scanner, none of these would have happened. Do you really think the main reason these guys took these phones so they can sell them back? 🤔. I thought Apple was the king 🤴 of protection 🤔 😕. Sorry for these people. I hate scammers. Should be in jail forever.
You cannot change the account password on Android using the lockscreen pin. So thats false information.
Isn't th passcode different from the appleid password
LESSONS LEARNED? DON'T BUY APPLE 😅
Use Face ID
Well, honestly this kinda looks an anti-Apple video! WSJ lately does this kinda videos to get users to doubt some companies. Its true that if and only if they get your phone, and see your password, they will have acces to some things, but its not soooo easy! They need to record your password, and then streal your device etc,etc,etc….WSJ, please make more interesting reports! This one sucks!
Fingerprint > Face Id.
Bro just use different password for apple id login and mobile. So they can only enter your phone they can't  change your apple id password and  also use other apps like app lock to lock your important app with different password
That's the thing ur passcode is like ur pincode for ur atm u don't just input it if someone is standing beside u. I feel like if u gonna input ur pass code in a bar that's not smart better to use fingerprint instead
Terrifying!
It's easier to solve by using your fingerprint to unlock everything. Nobody can copy that by just looking at you unlocking your phone. This is how Android does it.

Or by asking your iCloud password everytime you want to change your password or to access your saved passwords and asking fingerprints for payments.
When you attempt to link a new Mac to your Apple ID, Apple will prompt you for the login passwords (i.e. for the user account) of other Macs. It's odd that they don't do this on your phone. Seems like it would be an easy addition.
Hhahhaha they say apple is secure LOL 😂😂😂
those suggested advice for protection are bad and overwhelming.
Isn’t the simple solution just don’t use a pin password as your default phone unlock method, use FaceID or biometrics?
This is actualy worse than I tought. Even with the new feature of using physical security keys as a two facto authentification, you can still just input your iphone passcode. That is absurde, Apple should know enough about security to understand that if someone goes trough the hassle of securing their data as much as possible, this is not an aceptable practice.
Apple should have touch ID and pass code for some functionalities e.g.changing password etc
But why dont they just use face-id?🤦🏼‍♂️
Lol. Americans: AppLe Is SaFe. It PrOteCTs mE. 

Sure it does, sweetheart. Sure it does. This is the problem of a closed ecosystem. Welcome to reality.
It’s 2023 and people still think Apple and the iPhone are the most secure devices?! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
After watching this, I realized my Google Authenticator app didn’t require any authentication and if someone got my phone, they had all my 2FA also. Sure, you can protect with FaceID, but that’s easily overwritten after someone steals the phone and creates a new FaceID. This will require more research. 

Regarding 2FA with SMS, I guess a good idea would be to contact your carrier right away and try and suspend the number. Time would be if the essence here though.
I am not familiar with Apple products, so please can somebody help me understand how at 4:21 they say to change to a new Passcode enter the old Passcode.  How did the thieves find the old passcode and in under 3 minutes?  What am I missing?  Don't tell me they guessed.  Was the thief closely watching the owner when they entered the code?
Will using your finger print of face ID not fix the issue??? A finger print is harder to get than a 6 digit pin i would believe.
This wouldn't have happened if she used finger sensor to unlock phone instead of passcode
Wunderbar
Apple should just use Face ID to change passwords! No one can duplicate your face!
You failed to mention that 99% of Android phones have fingerprint sensor
Get an thief-proof Android phone instead! "Ta-da! It's... it's _not_ gone!"
The huge takeaway here is that thieves target iPhone users who DO NOT have Touch ID or Face ID enabled.  If you use biometrics on your Apple devices, this would not be an issue.  In my line of work, I have encountered many that "don't trust" biometrics and thus do not have them enabled.  Takes a lot of convincing to get them to turn those on.      The ONLY time I enter my iPhone's passcode is when I reboot it, but that rarely if ever happens outside a safe environment where someone is not looking over my shoulder.  Awareness of the device features and having situational awareness are the true keys.
A thief just has to press your iPhone lock button five times in a row and then you’ll be forced to input your phone password before you can use FaceID again. 

Very easy to do if they’re chatting to you at a bar/pretending to be your friend and you leave your phone on the table for a few seconds…
Trillion dollar problem ? Absolutely not, Want solve this ? Well why ? Apple is bs, no fingerprint unlock... Why?
This is part of why I never use any auto password login.  Each thing I log into needs me to actually enter *that* password.

I don't trust phones, tablets, online systems, etc, to keep my information secure.
my strap not gon let dis happen on da trails
And that from Apple, the company that is talking, marketing and praising security and privacy in every second ad or keynote… 🤡
Yubi key for icloud
Hey guys this is a great opportunity to experience Android and windows OS. Since everything is seperate and secure, either one of them would be accessible. Both Android and windows have fingerprint inbuilt along with face id.
Didn't know people still use passcodes. I've been using fingerprint ID on my Android phones for years.
That’s why there’s faceid, so that you don’t give away your passcode when inputting it…
Lesson don’t unlock your phone with a passcode at a bar or anyplace at night
The very best way not to lose your memories is not touching your phone when a memorable event happens.
You're welcome!
Use a burner phone when out in public.
Don’t put a screenshot of lastpass smh. They had a big security breach..
The only simple way I can think of to make this more secure quickly is for the passcode and biometric to be required to change the passcode.
Stupid muricon banks!!! Being able to electronically transfer that amount of money! It is extreme and not needed.
Where is Tim Cook now?
Interesting that they showed LastPass as an example of a good password manager. Do some research before choosing a password manager.
TouchID on button or under-display fingerprint sensor and FaceID should be combined into one and perfect for security in future
This is unfortunate on both sides. Apple is lazy and getting lazier. You can't say your policies are in place to protect account holders from unauthorized users, and yet you essentially allow a blanket reset of a master password on a phone with little more than a 6 digital passcode with no verification process. The fact that an account can't be recovered knowing the phone is being used and logged in with an appleID is baffling. Other side is people are way too comfortable and lack situational awareness when you're out. Don't type your passcode into your phone when you are out in a crowded public space, use faceid, pay attention to your device.
That’s terrific!!!
i personally use bitwarden self hosted (on my own home server, accessable anywhere I have internet)
The same has happened to me, 3 times by now. I originally thought my password was changed as well only to discover that the password only worked on my devices. My devices had a different character mapping and all my devices ran a mediated interface keeping me isolated and unaware. 

If i walked into my brach today and use a cutomer terminal and type in the account password that is on my my phone it will fail, while it operates perfectly on my device. Im sure if this coz ive repeatedly attempted to bring this to the attention of @fnbsa to no avail.
We should fit ourselves with NFC tags so our phones only unlock when we are near them 😆
I’m bouta head to the bar, bouta make bank ong
If only they had a fingerprint sensor they could rely on
Be careful, even your car VIN is a window to your life. Criminals only have to right once.
Android phones usually have fingerprint scanner as additional security option to pass code or face ID. Apple could easily add this option to future devices. Peace
Apple:. You're securitying wrong. 
Also Apple: We're the bestest security/privacy/honestly kings
Pinocchio: oh Tim your nose
Giving it all to Apple what could possibly go wrong..🙄
The comment about passcode doing the same in android (on a pixel anyway)is simply wrong.

I just checked, you have to enter your current PASSWORD before you can change your password

That's pretty poor to spread miss information like that
It could be much worse, some careless but untouchable companies could misuse your Social Security ID as a password, something it is absolutely not designed for. Oh, wait...
More incentive for me to not use an iPhone. Easily I'm being put into that 1%.
Maybe allow applocks? I like applocks
Obviously this lady, low iq as she seems, knew nothing about MFA. Get a brick phone and stop complaining if you can’t protect yourself.
There's an Face ID instead of typing passcode right?
Um... i don't get it, you've got your phone stolen... why not contact your bank immediately and ask them to block your Banking account?
One more reason I'm on a Pixel 7 now running GrapheneOS
Lock the phone thieves in solitary confinement and throw their keys away. Only way to solve this.
Wth. My own bank doesn’t even let me take out more then $500 in one day. How they take tens of thousands?
If you put a banking app on a phone you are basically asking for trouble.
Step 1. Create a screen time password to lock iCloud account changes. Problem solved.
⚠You can add an additional layer of security for your Apple ID which is security keys. These are physical usb/NFC devices that get linked to your Apple ID and when logging in you need one of those. The downsides are that it's really important not losing them (but Apple requires to have at least two of these) and the fact that these devices are usually not really cheap. It's not clear to me if you can still access your account without these tokens if you have another trusted device with you.
This is a ridiculous security oversight that Apple needs to fix right away. So much data cannot be secured by a single point of failure.
Apple MUST DO MORE!
THANKS Joanna for alerting everyone!
Thanks to this video longing on you your phone is going to be more annoying. Just watch for who is watching behind you or use Face ID in public
I really appreciate that you mentioned this can happen on Android too, and that it happens mostly on iPhones because of the resale value. Lots of tech journalists with a bias would omit that information to look Android phones look better.
Honestly this is what I think about all the time. Especially with computers, chrome uses your entry password for unlocking all passwords
Watching this was quite sobering and scary…especially the password manager bit
Samsung has a secure folder for this very reason. A secondary pass protected security wall that I was astounded Apple hasn't implemented its own version of. 
It's also another reason getting rid of biometric sensor was foolish. 
Nothing is fool proof. But Apple just makes it stupid easy.
Wow….Excellent reporting.
Distracted, a.k.a. drunk
It blows my mind that anyone would be dumb enough to take a photo of their own social security card. They may as well keep their life savings under the mat at their front door.
Just use Face ID. And use different passwords!
Android 😊
The Apple ID password should be required when change password is selected.  Crazy it only needs your pin.  Also? Apple should help this lady recover her apple account right now.
how about disabling the ability to change the passcode/location services via screen time?
Nothing new here! Should surfing and typical social engineering at play.
I have a solution get a privacy screen so nobody can see the screen
Better security already exists, it's call 2FA HARDWARE keys (Yubikeys, for example). And of course, don't put all your info into the same device.
I tried this on my iPhone 12 Pro Max... by blocking the camera for face ID and getting in with the pass code.  There is currently NO option to get into the phone's passwords without face ID recognition.  As far as photos go... put them in the Hidden folder which only uses face recognition for access now as well.  Maybe this was updated in one of their most recent security updates?  As far as changing the Apple ID password, that should be updated to facial recognition as well.  Some really good information though.  Scary.
That's why TouchID and FaceID exist, so you don't have to enter your passcode. And a thief can't steal your face or fingerprint. Even my dad's old iPhone 8 has TouchID.
In India once our phone is stolen we can directly call the Bank to freeze our bank hence thief cannot withdraw any money...
What happens if you turn off passcode, is it possible to only use FaceID or TouchID is passcode is turned off. ?
Alphanumeric screen lock.
Different passcodes for different apps.
Biometric security.
It isn't apple's fault that you are too lazy to take full advantage of their safety measures.
There isn't a legitimate bank in the world that won't instantly freeze all your accounts.
This is silly. 

At no point were touchID or FaceID mentioned, the specific features meant to prevent users from constantly putting in their passcodes. These are assets that cannot be duplicated or shoulder surfed. 

Plus if users have a watch the won’t need to show their entire face. 

The kicker: LastPass is considered the safe alternative. Hahaha
I always thought it's ridiculous how much access you get just by knowing the phone's passcode. Apple won't even let you password protect APPS, like, come on...
That's exactly why i have 2 phones
-IPhone which contains all my personal information and banking info
-Android (high end or midrange phone)
That's for everything except my personal and banking data i take it for work study or hangout and i really don't care if it got stolen
Need geoloc based PW requirements

I don’t need FaceID at home
But want it required in public
At 4:25 the reporter meant to say the attacker can change the iPhone's Apple *password*, not change the numeric passcode, after entering only the numeric passcode.

On my Google Android phone I need both my phone's passcode *and my current Google password* in order to change my Google password. This would prevent the attack shown in the video, which only required knowledge of the numeric passcode to lock the phone's owner out of their Apple iCloud account.
Holy... That Apple ID loophole is RIDICULOUS. That needs to be fixed ASAP. So dangerous.
🔓Privacy, that is iPhone
This was brought to you by password manager app. Just kidding,this reporting is spot on. Thanks ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
LastPass, of all of the password managers, is featured here? The one that just leaked the entirety of everyone’s vaults to hackers? Really?!
To solve this specific issue do the following:

- Go to "settings" and enable "screen time" (if not already enabled)
- Set a passcode (make sure it is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from your normal passcode) / go through the setup
- Then, in the "screen time" setting, go to "content & privacy restrictions"
- At the bottom, for both "passcode changes" and "account changes", set them both to "don't allow"

Now, when you go back to the main settings menu, you'll notice at the very top that access to your Apple ID settings are greyed out (and locked). In order or anyone that gets ahold of your phone to access your Apple ID settings to change your passcodes, they will need that completely different passcode that you just set in the "screen time" setting. So even if your phone gets stolen, you'll have peace of mind that they won't be able to change your passwords and lock you out.
MFA is a good solution!!
@apple bring back Touch ID 8:08
Or just use Face ID instead of typing it…
This is totally overcome by events weeks ago when an Apple update allowed the use of hardware security keys.  If you use a hardware security key on your AppleID, no one can change your Password without the physical hardware key that you keep safely in your home.  Always use FaceID or TouchID and have at least a 6 digit code to protect your phone.  You could also turn on auto-erase where your phone is erased if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times.   And a point of order, NEVER delete the passwords your keychain.  You do NOT need to pay a 3rd vendor to save the passwords.
Thanks for reporting on this. I never realized Apple doesn’t require 2FA or old password verification when setting a new password.
Why wasn’t she using Face ID?
So I shouldn’t let my friends know my code?
Its interesting that Touch ID was so much better than pins or Face ID yet its deprecated.  I'd say most of the burden here rest with the users though.   It is their ignorance and complacency mixed with trust for a company like Apple that puts them in this situation.   Apple's shoddy practices just expose the threat here.
Apple should allow to change passcode by face id . If theif enrolls new face apple should know that unknown face has been enrolled . Then this should not allow password to be changed as iPhone detects new face and turn on double factor authentication to change on secondary device like apple watch / or mac . Then they should disable the password change option permanently till actual owner has been found basically i mean iPhone should lock to owner by face id . Not by passcode which is unsecure
That's my passcode
Ha! With my bank I can only access any financial movements with a physical token. So any thief would need the phone's passcode, the bank password and the physical token. Triple security ftw
Just don’t use LastPass
8:27 DON’T USE LASTPASS!!
These people are not following common sense techniques.  They show no knowledge or common sense of digitial security.  Some of the advice given is weak or bad.  Very very poor reporting
You had me until the tacit endorsement of LastPass. Are you unaware of the multiple breaches and poor consumer communications? You need to dig a little harder and amend this video. https://youtu.be/9XWHCF4pLmI
I would say there should be backup password that apple the user can save in printed format(like personal code for each and everyone and user and apple has to have diffrent code as well), if something happens apple or user can use that 2nd passwrd to unlock/restrict the phone. and passkey and hidden photos has to have diffrent password option and also in photos when we create album we need to protect with diffrent passowrd( so that we can move pictures of passport or any sensitive to that folder) and last thing is we need hidden menu option or app folder, and only with password we can open, so that we can save our banking and other private apps(notes) can save in that folder, and FInd my, passkey, E-sim detativation, Icloud should be under diffrent settings and has to have dual prottection like faceid+password. what is your opinion?
How has she used iCloud over 15 years, when it was released in 2011? 🗿☠️
The problem with close systems is that once the weakest link break, everything goes appart. One of the biggest advantages android phones have is that there is flexibility, meaning you will have everything in diffferent services all of them using different ways of handling things. 

For example, I have my photos in google fotos, that I can access through my email if things goes south. 

My password through third party password manager. 

Because the android ecosystem doesnt entice me to get everything google. I have the flexibility to do things like these and be protected in case of.
I don't store password in Apple's inbuilt password manager. I use third party password manager, which opens only with app password (diff from apple lockscreen password) or face id.
this is why we use keepassxc and grapheneos kids!
I don’t use KeyChain, for that reason. I use a separate password manager (1Password in my case, but any other will do) so I decouple the device from the data and thus minimize the risk of losing it all.
use FaceID
I mean, this all boils down to the user letting someone see their passcode. There’s only so much that Apple or any other company can do to protect against that.
So much for removing the fingerprint scanner. Courage they call it.
if have family sharing you can have it require a 2-step verification code on another device or just make it in screentime so you just can't change password.
This is probably the backdoor apple designed for law enforcement to gain access to your files
Apple sucks
And that's why Touch ID is better than Face ID
In India to transfer money from phone, you need another Security pin or thumbs print..
I always had a bad feeling about Apple even as a teenager back in 1997. I never trusted them.
Android FTW
I'm sorry but it's never a good idea to have all your info on a server you don't have physical access to. How people just trust servers is beyond me. Placing blind trust in a tech giant ecosystem is asking for trouble.

I personally use Nextcloud and Obsidian notes. All my pictures sync automatically to my Nextcloud server in my house, same with my Obsidian notes. And I have a 64 character password and 2FA on the server. Running on an Odroid SBC with a SSD.

People need to take control of their digital lives.
I love my Android phones! Using a Galaxy S9 Plus. Never had any issues!
I normally avoid to take advantage of Face ID or password manager for financial applications. Something is the back of my head says just in case 😅
The only workaround for this exploitation is that to but screen-time on and restrict updating the Apple ID and the passcode without the screen time pin. However, the limitation is that the pin is only 4 digits.
How to fix 👉 just use Touch ID or scanning your face by the way for the Face ID you need an iPhone X and up and for Touch ID you need a 6s and up
Why is this only an iPhone problem?
Sad story. Do these criminals know they can just make more money working in IT without stealing? 300k for a ring of people comes to what, 30k each? Still below minimum wage.
Just switching to Android can reduce your risk by 99%😂
There are other options to protect your phone security. You can put an alphanumerical password.
Carelessness has a cost.
Hahaha I’m sorry but that’s the consumers fault. If you trust apple your crazy. They just want your money they don’t care. It’s like our politicians
It’s unreal that I so many countries you have a password for your banking details ??

It’s insane!

In Sweden we have secure login for the bank and an additional  secure app to be to log in to the bank.

Banks should just STOP having a password for a banking login. It ain’t apples fault
This was good info except recommending lastpass!
Why not just use Face ID? I almost never use my passcode unless the rare occasion I restart my phone.
One of the reasons why I dont save Banking Passwords on IOS or Google Chrome
I didn't notice this but Apple should really make you insert your Apple ID before you can change it
Apple don't care about WHITE PEOPLE! 😲
People are way to nonchalant in putting in their passcode in public, try shielding your phone just a little bit.
The solution is to have two different Passcodes, one to get into your phone and a completely different Passcode once you're on your phone.
Their digital lives aren't gone! Fake drama.
I live in Hong Kong, banking app simply does NOT allow password to be saved.
8:42 LastPass .. are you kidding me??!! 👈🤣 LastPass was broken into and everyone's "secret" info stolen. No, If you can remember a password to something like LastPass then you certainly can remember a password to the most important thing or one of the most important things you have your bank account!!!
That's why i trust Android phone always 😎 as it gives to password system...one can unlock ur screen but for rest u need another password... example even to open ur phone gallery to Gmail....etc etc...thanks Google 🥰.
How did they get into their banking apps?
Actually Apple can ensure that any change in passcode is to be validated through an alternative device in the user ecosystem.
Thank you, that was informative.
sorry but that’s the same like  banking cards. never let someone see your code!!!!
Why did you show a LastPass screenshot at the end of your video?? Did you not hear about the data breach and their misleading response?
Good luck doing that on GrapheneOS, that has a pascode scrambler.
This is why I will never use an iPhone. My Samsung note 20 has a finger print scanner, it's been a godsend.
I consider myself tech savvy. Everything connected, everything cloud, everything 2FA, complex 10 digit passcode, etc etc. And I honestly thought, I wasn’t going to learn anything from this video. I was wrong. Thanks for making this. Some bubbles have burst for me.
Didn’t Last Pass just get a major hack?
That’s why I backup at least my pictures notes and files to a flash drive once a week or even every day or so they shouldn’t of seen her passcode I only have to put my in once when I turn it on.
the solution to this is actually simple and already known.

USING the passcode is frequent.  CHANGING the passcode is rare.

setup a 5 question/answer around CHANGING the passcode (what is your fathers middle name, etc.) ... multiple steps required in order to CHANGE the passcode ... problem solved and not overly cumbersome to the end users.

i'll send my bill to iApple
I thought apple is about '' security and privacy"
JFC! I started watching this video thinking this lady was stupid, ignorant, and any other adjective you can think of. Boy was I wrong 😮 the simplicity of this is amazing. I hope since I never actually use my PIN that I am a little better off
Apple would argue that that’s what Touch ID and Face ID is for, so no one can see your password. This is so freaky! Thanks for the info.
I am a Q.A tester. Here's an easy "solution", or improvement: 

- make the buttons smaller
- no highlights behind the buttons when clicked
- more than just the passcode to change passwords, ASAP
- you need touch id and/or face id to change the passcode + confirmation on e-mail
- large sums of money/unusual activity requires additional confirmation
if your Apple Watch is on your wrist, you can remotely disable your phone.
Why would you keep your login detail saved especially for your bank account, and also why trust the `cloud´to save your photos ect ,thats rented space, is like trusting netflix not to lose rights to shows.
Also you should check sites like: Have I Been Pwned.
why is she not using biometrics in the first place?
This can be prevented as easy as fingerprint scanner. Bar is dark  faceid would fail hence the need to type passcode. Im glad no one gonna steal my android.
Kindly refrain from sharing all the information necessary for conducting a fraudulent activity. 🚫⚠️
The option to add security keys added in ios 16.3 should also solve the problem, right?
The lesson to learn; don’t use 1111 or 1234 as your password
You can activate restrictions to your iphone’s account. This 4 digit password can protect after the 6 digit password because block all changes in the account
Dashlane requires a primary password if FaceID doesn’t work.
Make sure you back your iPhone up so the photos stay with you!
Used fingerprint reader to open phone rather than a passcode. Safer and easier to use than entering a passcode
Man they really need to bring back the touch-id....
You can always ask someone who has an iPhone next to you for the “find my” app and lock your phone that way and note it as stolen.
Bitwarden. That's the password manager you're looking for. Stay away from Lastpass.
Keeping sensitive or secrets in Apple Notes is also unsecure.  You can only lock notes on your device and notes in iCloud. You can’t lock notes that have PDFs, audio, video, Keynote, Pages, or Numbers documents attached; notes that sync with other accounts; or Quick Notes. You can’t lock an iCloud note that has collaborators.  Also, on Mac devices, "Apple does not recommend using a separate screen time password with an administrator account", which almost all Mac users use as their default.
If only this stupid company included in-screen Fingerprint Scanner Touch ID just like every other manufacturer.
Apple 🍎 just add a delay between charging your passcode and turning off the Find My app.
What a fluff piece by Joanna Stern. Also who uses passcode when you have faced & touchid
Under-Display fingerprint is what apple users pretend they don't need.
Convenience comes at a price.
BTW Zoe Thomas is incapable of such quality reporting.
Congratulations to Joanna Stern once again for an excelent video. I hope Apple’s arrogance “Who’s to Say” attitude stop this time, and they get serious about some security issues. Give back our regular Sim Card Apple. Steve Jobs is dead. Get real.
Apple, please take this seriously!
Face ID and Touch ID do wonders. sorry to say….if it’s at a bar and whatnot….that’s on you. you’re being negligent. be responsible and keep your phone on your person. simple.
Im surprised after watching this you can really change your icloud password by just entering your passcode! Before, this was not the case, it needed your current password.
7:56 that's the worst advice, "treat it like an ATM pin" - best, just choose password instead of a PIN. That's at least what I use on my Android. Fingerprint + password (not PIN).
Also I’d like to point out that the lack of a regular sim card and full adoption of the eSim was a big mistake. No wonder that chinese iPhones are more expensive due to the 2 sim slot required by the government there that does not allow eSim. The main issue here is the fact that if I get my iPhone crashed or smashed or drowned, I have to go to the store and then to the carrier to get my phone back and running, loosing 1 or 2 days of connectivity. Instead, if any of those things happen with my phone and I have a regular sim card, chances are that I can remove it and insert in any other phone and continue to have connectivity and a phone until I have time to choose another one. Because you know, only a few people can go from an iPhone 13 to 14 in 24 hours…
Now that i’ve slept through, here’s 2 more cents about this:
1) Mostly many users underestimate the ithieves (or iscammers, take your pick). They actually have a standard flowchart on how to do these things. They do as Joanna Stern described. Most people doesn’t add up 2FA, Account Recovery Contacts or Legacy Contacts for that matter. Also most people have a sense of invulnerability regarding they phones and think that will never happen to them. You want to learn how these things work on a professional basis? Have a phone stolen in South America.

2) Another thing that is mind boggling about Apple is the fact that the feature “Screen Time” has many security features hidden there that mostly instagrammers shows the public, and sometimes those tutorials are completely wrong and misleading. Apple should have, or at least have considered, multimidia tutorials on it’s website to show the importance of some security culture and discipline.
So 2FA physical key 🗝 doesn't  protect you.
Most easy and best security would be to use both touch and faceid on devices to unlock apps we choose. Not a single passcode to access everything
No you need old password to change password in android- just checked on my pixel , on my iPhone yes big issue-but i use faceid and 2fa hardware key added.
I am Italian and Socialist behaviour are ofthen criticized by the american's, but solution ar3 sometimes simple. here the market of stolen phone is dead becouse the Hardware code is registered in an European database.. so a stollen phone can be immediately deactivated...
Fingerprint ID would stop all of this type of things until the thieves cut off fingers. That was how phones used to work.  One step forward, two steps back....
Just give the touch id back
Or or or, just don't use iCloud
Anything can be hacked. All you need is understanding of the system. I've been seeing console manufacturers coming up with new security measures but hackers always break them.
hhhhhmmmm....use Face ID or thumb print. Solved. This is a pointless video about people who fail to use the tech correctly. Perhaps renaming the video as " People who fail to use iPhone security features correctly"
my passcode is : 123456
Bring back fingerprint scanner
wsj can get new iphone from apple with new advertisements
iCloud is useless.  Apple support is useless.  They don’t care when they lose your photos.
A great opportunity for apple to add fingerprint scanner and increase the price of iPhone by $500
Here is a simple solution: Apple must get rid of "Enter your Passcode" whenever your Touch ID or Face ID fails after multiple attempts, It should just let you attempt to unlock with Face ID/ Touch ID indefinitely..."Enter passcode to unlock" should be an option not mandatory, 90% of the time when I take out my iPhone out of the pocket it says enter your passcode because faceID has been trying to unlock my phone whilst still in the pocket and it so annoying...Entering your passcode in public has never been safe....
II find it HILARIOUS that to install an APP on the APP STORE you need the APPLE ID PASSWORD but to change the whole Apple ID password all you need is THE IPHONE PASSCODE 

This is just ridiculous for a company that prides itself in security, this whole nightmare is human error, made by the humans who designed the step process to change an Apple ID password.
What happened to the fingerprint sensor?
It's much easier to repeat a steal with iphones because they all work the same. In an Android phone, you get lost quickly because the ecosystem is not unified. What the video suggests is the same: Break the apple ecosystem of services and use different ("unusual") tools for specific tasks. This does not solve the problem of stealing passcode then the phone. The vulnerability is in the *common steps* needed to steal money in millions of devices.
All of this could be prevented if they kept the finger print sensor 🙈
It's ridiculous you can unlock everything with your passcode.
Making faceID valueless.
Unlocking the phone is fine. Getting into all passwords and banking apps just with the same 6digit code is ridiculous.
Prefer Face ID …!! In public places and avoid entering passcodes.
Everyone needs to do these 3 steps:

1. Turn on Screen Time, set a distinct screen time passcode.
2. Enable Content & Privacy Restrictions
3. Within Content & Privacy Restrictions, set both Account Changes and Passcode Changes to Don’t Allow

This prevents an attacker from changing your Apple ID password or making changes to Face ID/Touch ID. It can’t block everything, though, but it limits the damage that can be done.
This is a user issue. Has nothing to do with Apple or Samsung. The same thing would apply if someone would visually see your pin and steal your bank card or know the login for your computer which contains all your logins to everywhere. If you're not using face id or touch to open your phone, and not being cognizant, its kind of your fault.
Yes android is the same in this regard..but android phones have fingerprint sensors so you don't really put in your password
true apple indoctrination, She is EMBARESSED to say on camera how long she had a fricking Laptop... the 123456 is probably her real password ;)
wow
Should just have a separate code for unlocking phone and other apps inside the phone
Simplest Solution to avoid these troubles :
Never enter your Pass code in public.
Always rely on biometric authentication...
For the iPhone users: That's called Face ID or Touch ID.
That's terrible but why aren't people using Face or Touch ID?? That's the whole point of biometric security.
ever heard of face ID
My iPhone has a very unique and long alphanumeric password for this exact reason. It should be mandatory. This device does way too much. Never ever backup to iCloud. If you work at an office, make it a habit. Show up on Monday, plug in, and backup to the computer. Stop expecting the companies to do the heavy-lifting for you. You’re in charge of keeping your house safe. Be in charge of your digital self.
Lol just cuz i have iPhone doesn’t mean i have any money for anyone to steal
Security is directly at odds with Convenience, so lets trust our security with a company obsessed with convenience! Brilliant!
Terrifying
Convenience comes at a cost. 

The reason we have password managers is so that we don’t need to remember multiple random passwords. Instead we have one strong password that unlocks all the other passwords.

People are just bad at remembering things which is why they pickup bad habits like short memorable passwords or reusing the same password.

Apple also supports FIDO physical security keys but again do you want to have to plug a
Key into your iPhone?
I figured out that this passcode to do everything is very insecure some time ago and now I use a long alphanumeric passcode. It is inconvenient when Face ID doesnt work but at least it is impossible for somebody to memorise the password when Im typing it in
If you delete the saved bank password from keychain then u have to enter it manually every time you want to log in which make you even vulnerable to. Best way would be to only use ur faceID
Android wins again?
Why would anyone leave his/her 'digital' life on an electronic device that can be prone to being stolen & info extracted out of?
Don’t use a PIN code, use a full password. You’re probably using biometrics to unlock your phone most of the time anyway.

Also, don’t use Keychain for your password manager. Use Bitwarden or 1Password instead.
Android phones have fingerprint scanners unlike apple. No one inputs their password there
So a thief can change the password in a couple of minutes, but I had to wait for 2 weeks for the Apple to send me a link to change my Apple ID password on my MacBook. Yes, that's a weird fact, if you have a MacBook and no iPhone then for changing an Apple ID Password you will have to wait for weeks for Apple to send you a password reset link. Indeed Apple is weird!
No matter what security Apple put in if the customer is the kind of this stupid then it's useless. I lost my iPhone before and nothing happened and I was able to recover it.
Well I don’t keep bank accounts on android
Apple should really consider touch id in addition to face unlock.
How is this Apple's fault and not these people who got drunk and lost their phones?
She couldn’t use FaceID, because she was at the bar off her face 😂
I use android. Every banking app I use has it's own separate PIN. Plus, any changes to my account requires my full password and an email or device verification. Two-step verification should be required on all phones, regardless of a user's wants. Also, lol that they showed LastPass after what they just went through.
So hence proved we should buy android phones not iPhone devices 😅😊
One way to prevent this is allow users to change apple id password by pin-code only if they have an other apple device. If they don’t apple id can be reset using old password. Say your iphone can talk to an other apple device say your mac and do some sort of authentication then allow users to change the pincode. I mean it won’t prevent it but will reduce the theft to a great extent
very helpful
This video is the best example of why Apple needs to implement in display touch ID for better security purposes 👍🏼
Don't worry Apple Users, iPhone 15 will hopefully have the in display fingerprint sensor!!!
I mean its not just apple, this could have happen on any android or iphone
This is why I NEVER save passcodes in the cloud.
lol,just use an android. Android has much better security nowadays and it is not based or dependant on one lockscreen password only.
Face unlock, keep your phone in your pocket. Stop being privileged, Ignorance is privilege.
Sheesh
Did I really just see a picture of LastPass when telling people to store sensitive documents WSJ!!!? LastPass has been heavily compromised! Do NOT use it!
Yet another reason to avoid all Apple products. Honestly in 2023 why does anyone still use an iPhone or a Mac as there are so many superior alternatives.
How has she been using ICloud for 15 years when it wasn't around before 2011?
Interesting video
I don’t know if this sounds far fetched, but I think Apple should stop letting people change their account passwords using _only_ their iPhones.

Changing the account password should be a process that relies on verification through a _second_ Apple device - and if the iPhone user doesn’t own a second Apple device, then he/she should be able carry out the verification process on the _iCloud website._
Biometrics.  The end.
FaceID or AppleID password to change AppleID password. Using the 6 digits is dumb.
Great reporting. I hope Apple sees this and fixes it.
So what i'm hearing is 000000 is pretty strong
Samsung!!
Apple don't have a fingerprint reader? Sorry for my ignorance, I'm not familiar with iphone.
Additional cost, but another option is using Security Keys (e.g. Google Titan Security Key, GoTrust Idem Key, etc)
I appreciate Samsung here for using only biometrics in Samsung Pass and not the device pin,  and the biometrics can only be changed with samsung cloud password.
Muthafuckers! should've use an android!!! DUMBASSES!!!!
Apple for dumb!
the thing called FaceID/touchID should be used and not your pin. your pin is only for when faceid is not working.  Your passwords are also protected by , guess what, your faceID. so they cannot access them if you have them locked. My iPhone only unlocks passwords using FaceID, same goes for bank apps. 
- make your pin alphanumeric
- enable erase of the data after 10 failed attempts
- set a recovery account
- if you have an Apple watch set to lost the iPhone from there

- The purpose of not asking the AppleID is because you supposedly set the device to allow you to change the password from the device in case your forgot it. So disable this setting and you are no longer able to change the password without asking for the old one. Hopefully your recovery of password does include something else other than the phone number on your device or the email on your device. 

Using Lastpass the most vulnerable password manager in the history is not advisable.
Despite all protections thief can still force us to unlock everything for them using a gun
Just Two Words: Fingerprint Reader.


Android wins.
using passcodes on thousand dollar phones in an era where any 200 usd android phones has finger print reader
Pretty much defines fear mongering…. Manually entering a pass code is so 2018… Now with touch-I’d or facial-rec, this entire report is moot.
Fingerprint its more secure
This sounds like scare tactics to get people to give them their facial or fingerprints in their systems! It’s as simple as making a person enter their current AppleID before a person can change it. It’s as horrifying that zero persons at Apple considered this let alone have already implemented this as knowing thieves are watching. Which is still weird bcz everyone doesn’t have their debit CC info on their phones! OR buy a security screen? Not sure why they are pushing your personal digital info!
If you lose your credit card, you can just call the card company and deactivate your card. Apple should provide the same level of customer service as card companies do. They are a financial service provider. The same should applies to Android too.
Why would someone use a passcode in public on an iphone 13? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Face ID people
If it is convenient, it is not secure...
Under Settings/Face ID & Passcode. Scroll to the bottom where it says “allow access when locked” then turn off the following: Control Center, wallet, and accessories. Incase they forget the passcode. The thrift won’t be able to turn airplane mode on. You’ll be able to track the phone even when powered off. 

Also to regain access to your account. Recommend updating to IOS 16 and securing your iCloud account with a set of Yubikeys.  Even if they “change the password” you’ll have the master key to the account. Remember. NOT YOU KEYS NOT YOUR ACCOUNT. You should be the holder of the master key. Not apple or a crook.
Who doesn't use fingerprints these days?
This problem is more than the apple is security with the phone owner, in the first moment, why do you unlock the iphone with the passcode and not with the finger print or faceID? we have those securities since iphone 5s. and second, if you go to a bar is to socialice with the people not with your phone. Sorry but if I will go to some public place is to socialice not be in the phone, better stay at home relaxed.
So how would a thief know the iPhone Lock Screen code that is required to even gain access to change one's Apple ID Password? It's not as if that information is divulged during the process of the theft...do they just brute force and reattempt with different codes,  over and over?
I mean, if people were better educated on digital security, this wouldn’t be an issue.
OMG its so stupid to advertise lastpass at the end of the video, because at the end of 2022 hackers stole all the data of all the customers from them
Shoddy buggin, i had 4 digits lol
This just happened to my mom’s phone the password changed by itself from 6 digits to 4
android isn't as susceptible to this because you need a google account manager to access the password manager, plus many things are fingerprint locked for extra security
Apple purposely makes the menu options a jumbled mess and switches their positions every update so that you can never know or remember where anything is. Microsoft does this too. And willing to bet so does google.
Android users feeling proud 🥲
Giving an option for users to enable dual authentication (Pin + Biometric) before changing their Apple ID credentials can clearly solve this.
It seems Apple updated the change password process. It does require user type current password first before change password. This video is not accurate
Bottom-line, get an Android.
Apple should have a different password for find my iphone..
99% of them were iPhones not just because they have higher resale value but also because Android doesn't rely so heavily on one passcode or one ecosystem. That's why not living in a monopolistic ecosystem is recommended. Every app on my android phone has a different password for sensitive data especially. Or require the fingerprint and if the fingerprint is changed or a new one is added to the list... That new one has to be linked with the app via passwords.
Thank you for this story- now I know how to use my phone in a more secure manner while in public. Hopefully Apple views this video as well!
Too much convenience is never a good thing.
Very insightful, some obvious points that consumers are aware of but just choose to ignore these. This video will probably help everyone rethink the security which they have set up on their phone and improve it by making the suggested changes. Thank you.
I cant beleive she had the best iphone BUT WASNT USING IT ,,,
SHE was using her iphone 13 pro max like if it was a iphone 5 ,,like cmon
Use bitwarden. You don’t want to give everything to Apple.
They should add support for yubikey for accessing anything with Apple ID
Maybe don't let people see you unlock your phone maybe?? Lol
My old fashioned self just use credit cards for 99% of payment, mainly to earn points. They have human customers service 24/7 in loss prevention department. Only took few minutes for them to block my cards and got refunded for purchases I didn't authorized.
I never wanted to put everything in one device for this reason.my credit card is not link to bank for withdrawal.  People frequently put their phone on counters, chairs, shopping carts , worst is on Uber seats.
I always feel that apple pay allowed spending without actually know how much the value of the money, it's too convenient. I won't go as extreme as paying by cash, but I like earning points on credit card s, building credit history and they have a loss prevention department.
man ios is so fukking dumb 😂 just use android for security, also harder to hack
1. Your phones is robbed from YOU. 2. YOU type your password openly in a bar, DRUNK. As always in the cryptography world, human is the weakest point. Now you're blaming Apple for all your human errors 🤦‍♂
Very simple and obvious fix. Require the password to change the passcode.
Why not use Face ID ?????
you'll blaming iphone for protecting your phone. Just keep your phone secured yourself thats all. Do you want apple to do everything for you
not a problem for android users. only applicable to USA and parts of Europe.
It's not the phone's fault, it's just the users. It's like losing your key and claiming that the home developer should be having guards at your door, you don't pay enough for that. The reality is phone verification is the key to the digital information, dual verification often involves text code, and password can be stolen in many ways. Credit Cards being linked to Paypal, Google Pay, etc are often at risk but you can call the banks to get those frozen asap. The most 2 important things in mobile is never save your bank related login information and get a separate bank account just for your mobile life. Not having bank login in mobile is useful but we often tie our accounts to another app, so it's important to have a separate checking account for Venmo, Paypal, Google Pay, etc, I keep an "allowance checking account" that is usually under $500 at any given time which I refill as needed from my home computer or via app at a private location. Even if someone manage to get your phone and unlocked your venmo, they can't get into your saving account or primary checking/payroll account.
Use face id on public and change your passcode to alphanumeric, that’s just all average people need to do and only your phone gets stolen. Some extra tips is use eSim, deactivate siri when phone is locked and make longer passcode for your apple watch. I will continue using keychain, keep my files and photos on iCloud because it’s convenient and safe if I do my part as a user
Although not as problematic, this is why I hate Microsoft decision to use microsoft account password as windows password
How is this news? Being drunk has consequences.
Guess this is the blowback for putting all your apples in one basket.
Fingerprint ID  is the best, UNFORTUNATELY apple will never adopt to it
Now I'm gonna make sure that I only use face ID to unlock my phone in public.
Why did Apple remove fingerprint lock? Android has it
The video was great, up until the very end. Then you showed LastPass at 8:43, and that’s when I did 🤦‍♂️.
The security in just name only 🤣🤣🤣
Face- ID.
So it's much wiser to own an android instead 😂😂😂
"There's a sucker born every minute".  Apple is a fan of P. T. Barnum.
Apple should consider to change the passcodes method into a secure and secret way of unlocking
It was saying my daughter put on my phone I don't know if other people have done it or not you don't have to hold your phone anymore in it It's have your phone just in your pocket and say OK Google can you find me this can you find me that you can talk to your phone call the police or anybody else without holding your phone you can dial numbers any place that you want to dial talking to the phone will do it so I never hold my phone in my hand ever and if I do I'm on my scooter my back is against the wall and I do carry mace I carry it I carry spray and I also carry  Bear spray but I always have my back against the wall.
Apple iCloud has been hacked as well. Apple is not good at security, what it is good at is giving convenience to people and make their lives easier, which is not always the best idea. Some form of discomfort to achieve better management of apps with respect to security is needed, ask for the old password, use face ID for password manager and block after few unsuccessful attempts and notify the user and until action comes from elsewhere (from other devices like windows, android and from a trusted source like email on file etc) when apple devices are locked out keep the accounts locked.
This video just prompted me to switch to an alphanumerical passcode for my phone. Good topic to cover!
You still have your memories in your mind. Oh wait, instead of living in the moment you instead record so you can post it.
This has been happening in South Africa for a while now. At first I didn't believe it because of how much I trust technology, but having read about it several times, I've decided to uninstall any banking apps from my iPhone. The minor convenience of being able to make payments and transfers on the go is not worth what you stand to lose.
To protest against the sham Legislative Council of Hongkong, our channel has produced a derivative music piece "Frogheat" (original "Megahit" by Anson Lo). Please like and share✨
I have spent 10 mins and found a solution.  Which is to enable screen time with a different pin.  

Disable the following in Content and Privacy Restrictions:
1. Location setting
2. Find my iPhone setting
3. Account changes
4. Passcode changes 
5. Mobile data changes


This basically lock down your critical iPhone components with a different passcode.  Even if they know your normal one, they can’t access your other details. 

Just don’t store banking passwords in Apple Password as WSJ said.
Why would you promote LastPass to your audience when it just was hacked
But dont use lastpass
Apple! 
Bring back Touch ID on iPhone - Face ID will never be good enough.
Blockchain people
Had it been finger print then passcode entry need not be a thing ...apple idiot
Surely having Lastpass so prominent is also not very safe, as they have been recently hacked 🤔 Another advantage in keeping a Sim card as you can lock those as well
iPhone security
Bitwarden is a great alternative.
Like why not ask for the current apple id password before changing it???
Apple needs to enable a separate password on the lock screen and the password manager on the settings app
if you are using indian bank tech then its not possible..you can call the bank and just block transaction in minutes
Yeah I don't save my bank info with icloud. I use separate password manager w/ different password. All eggs in 1 basket is always a problem.
This is why I use an alphanumeric passcode 😨 and I use Face ID so I don’t have to use passcode
Um, you sit at a bar or club, using your phone without paying the slightest bit of attention to what 's going on around you - well, you asked for it ! !
😮
LastPass was hacked twice last year. Yeah they got the password database and some of that data isn’t even encrypted!
It’s not just an Apple iPhone problem.
Good reporting. I'm sure apple will do something about it. never use your passcode in public is the key here
Was this happening before introduction of FaceID? FaceID does NOT work in a lot of edge cases, i.e. a dark bar, and forces you to enter your passcode. I still have an iPhone 8 and haven’t entered my passcode in months!! Because the fingerprint reader just works (wet fingers not included).
In Brazil it’s common to have 2 smartphones, one stay at home with the bank and financial apps while the other one to be used outside. Another security layer lies on the screen time passcode. If it’s set with a different passcode  it can be useful to block account changes, passcode changes and cellular data changes
Joanna, thank you so much for reporting on this. This is a HUGE issue. Especially since even if a victim were able to beat the thief to Find My iPhone, enabling Lost Mode would be pointless since the passcode can immediately disable it. This would leave only the option of trying to erase the device (again with the victim having to "beat" the thief to FMI) . There is definitely a huge hole with the security on iOS that needs to be fixed.
Absolutely negligent design by Apple. The purpose of a PIN is for quick access. There is no way a pin should be able to do this much.
Welcome to Android
So Touch ID?
What about using "Screentime Restrictions" to block "Account Changes" with a screentime PIN different from your main passcode?
Solution maybe (and I haven’t considered all eventualities I admit), is one password for access to phone and a different passcode to access to all other information. Maybe cumbersome. But will help perhaps.
I just tried this attack on myself. Some have suggested using the old Apple Id password to change the password, but this is not foolproof. Attempting to log in to my Apple Id on the website, I was able to reset my Apple Id password by using the “forgot my password” option which sends a 2FA code to the compromised phone. From there the thief can change the Apple Id email through the website and lock you out of your Apple account. What I find bewildering is that Apple sends to the original email that the Apple Id email has been changed and that you should “reset your password”. You can’t reset your password without knowing the new Apple Id. Without your Apple Id the recovery key also becomes useless.

This is such a complicated problem but one that needs to be resolved. Whereas other companies would let more advanced users use hardware security keys to lock down their accounts, Apple forces us to use our devices as our “security key”. This is problematic as our devices have multiple functions, not just being a security key, and is thus harder to secure. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised for Apple to respond to this issue with a pricy and proprietary hardware security key to help recover our accounts rather than letting us use off-the-shelf hardware security keys.
Weren't you just with  Craig Federighi praising Apple about their security and the new end-to-end encryption?
They not only do this in brazil but they steal phones unlocked even if you have face id. One step you can make is to use screentime and use a local password to app limit the time of the apps to say 1 min. So all of those apps will be limited unless the person knows the local password. Also, you can use screentime to disable apple id button in settings to avoid making it so easy to change your apple id password.
two factor authentication, one time password when changing password?
Pretty hilarious how the highlighted recommended solutions include LastPass, the app which last month just got a massive leak.
We need more of WSJ tech/investigative journalism to make REAL impacts. Not just some leaks about next titanium iPhone. (Those are fun too, but not as important as what this piece is).
lastpass isn’t a good example of a secure password manager💀
That’s why you should enable complex pass codes that are alpha numeric. Takes more effort to login but way more secure.
It's time for Apple to use Face ID for 2nd layer of security
It's time for Apple to use Face ID for 2nd layer of security
Why not Apple use the 2 step verification for changing passwords?
Very important video super important!!! We need better security for our phones!!! Apple we need solutions
Just offer to randomise the layout of passcodes not longer 123 but 213 and every time different
I never use my passcode. My Face ID is all I need so not sure.
Removing Touch ID from the iPhone was one of Apple's worst decisions.  Forcing everyone to use Face ID instead of having both options made many people use passcodes that are simple and create awful loopholes like this to happen.  We should be adding more security options, not taking them away.
Simple solution: Never input your passcode whenever there's somebody who might possibly see you logging in your passcode. Stolen passcode=stolen life.
I have a fingerprint reader and i don't use passcode.
Bit Warden for the win!
Bring Touch ID back
takeaway from this : never key in yr iPhone passcode in public
This is why you don't use a passcode to unlock in public and use biometrics.
Extreme important!
The officers comment that he sees this happening with 99% of iPhones is due to its higher resale is ridiculous. Although iPhones do have higher resale than Android, it happens predominantly with iPhones because of it's poor security. Thieves are not stealing iPhones for resale when they can just clear your bank account! Separate passwords for screen lock which is different from either your Google or Samsung user id/password.
Have a different passcode for keychain
Why would I need to put my iPhones passcode in public, when I have to do that, I make sure no one is watching, and when I go put the code in, I try my absolute best to not make it too visible anyone else, the only time I do that is when I restart my iPhone/Apple Watch or when passcode is required
crazy how you are suggesting people to use lastpass or 1 password.

use keepass you savages
Many have mentioned FaceID and TouchID, but it won't be a full solution: Thieves will just point the phone to your face for Face ID or rip your finger off for Touch ID and then change your passwords, and you have the exact same problem as before!
Kind of ironic how they show Lastpass near the end when they've had a big data breach
I can never open my phone with FaceID in the morning- always have to enter the code.
biometric + biometric two factor authentication is the future of security. swipe, passcode, 15 character passwords will be obsolete
Seems like touch Id was better!
this is why i dont use a password manager
They should add security feature for connection between Apple Watch and iPhone. If someone steals an iPhone and it's far from the apple watch, it automatically put iPhone in lockdown mode restricting thief from inputting passcode to access the iPhone data inside
6:37 No, we have fingerprint readers... they need to chop off our fingers first.
Apple can easily fix this with an ultrasonic fingerprint reader under the screen but chooses not to.
Let's face it, if you use an iPhone or a Mac - you're not the brightest user.
this is why I hate that it forces you to use passcode after x amounts of Face ID uses, apparently it's more sEcUre
fingerprints should be standard, oh well
mSecure is a great secure password database on for the iphone. Lastpass sync's the ios app with the same data as you laptop version.
This is why Edward Snowden uses a head blanket when typing in his password.
Seriously they show LastPass as a password manager? Do they not read the news? And what's the deal with dragging down Android without any research?
Them: I lost my iPhone and all my money are gone! They use my passcode to access this!

Apple: You are using your iPhone passcode wrong
They need to enforce 2 factor auth so you can't change it without the 2FA. And people need to stop being dumb.
What kind of idiot stores their financial passwords on these types of integrated keyrings?!?   Its for your Netflix password, not your bank password.
Advancements are always welcome, as long as it doesn’t lessen the current user experience and convenience. Otherwise, these are likely few enough instances to warrant any change.
Don't use iphone anymore, it's not secure as you think.
Why I use android. It's just more secure.
Shocking that some apple users still use passcode to unlock their phone.

If they just use biometrics, then we wouldnt have this conversation 😅😅
and apple loves china, they rather support forced labor in china.
The only silverlining I thought I had for a second was that I use another password manager for banking but immediately realized that my emails are wide open along with OTP; which means they can reset my bank password too
In order to change the Apple ID password, Apple should not only request the Apple PIN but also request the old password and also a security question must be answered.
Easy fix for Apple, Update: Require previous iCloud password to change Icloud password, and Require alphanumeric password to access iCloud keychain when biometrics is off. LETS GeT On it APPLE!!!!!
Apple recently added the ability to use a security key as a form of two-factor authentication. It’s in the same menu that was shown when changing your password. The security key is a physical device that can be kept on a keychain, for example.
The popularity of the IPhone works against it in this case. Android phones *could* be exploited, sure, but the sheer popularity of the IPhone (in the US, at least), plus the fact that every IPhone is *exactly* the same (Settings menu, etc) that the perpetrators could, once they know the six-digit passcode, simply work off muscle memory and within minutes finish the job. Android phones simply might not be worth it to go after.
Maybe don't go to a bar...
This just makes you reconsider Apple’s security marketing
Good advice, though WSJ shouldn't have recommended LastPass as a 3rd party password manager. It was hacked and they handled it very poorly.
Use FACE ID and Touch ID as a temporary measure until Apple make this more secure?
basic investment 101: diversify
How could the thief can know both password of iPhone pass code and iPhone id password?
Does it happen to apple users only? Anyone can record android user as well while entering the pin. 
Plus why not use faceid?
Joanna, this is great reporting, but you failed to report on the built in way that iOS in fact does provides its users to be protected against this attack, and has been available since iOS 12 (2018). All you need to do is go into iOS's Screen Time settings (turn it on if necessary, set a password different than the device's password), then go to '"Content & Privacy Restrictions", then down to "Passcode Changes" and "Account Changes", then set "Don't Allow" to both. This makes it necessary to enter this second password in order to not only change the iCloud PW but also to make any changes to your account.
Apple should have never gotten into the banking service with Apple Pay when they are not specialized with banking security measures!
Careful in choosing a 3rd party password manager as well...
the drawback of putting your entire digital life (personal & financial) in a pocket computer.. 😑
If you ever get ANY of your devices stolen call your bank immediately and have them lock down your account.
Imagine you got a gun to your head to type your passcode in
3:56 you were able to do that because surely your device isn’t registered to your friends account 🤦🏽‍♂️ ‘Find my’ is useless without another Apple device on the same account technically
They can make it so that it asks for a Security Question before letting you reset your passcode. Problem solved
So people go out to drink (makes them more alert), punch in numeric PIN's and that's Apple's fault?  ROFL.  F-8ng incredible baitclick headline.  
Maybe:  "Drinking in bars at night leads to financial ruin for some people." would be more accurate?
iCloud is not a backup - it is a convenience - backup things where you can recover them.
And yes, duh, passwords must be different
And yes, duh, FaceID / TouchID are far better.
What a ridiculous click bait video title. 
Should be: fools get fooled.  Film at eleven.
Just use 2 phones 💀like me
Weird that I need to enter my Apple ID password (not my pin) to download an app if Touch ID doesn’t work.  But somehow everything can be changed with just a pin?   Apple should allow a separate pin for accessing financial/sensitive apps.
Thank you for bringing attention to this, Joanna!
The problem is people are already using passcodes instead of Face ID. The only other alternative is to have an Apple Watch with the unlock setting enabled, using a different passcode on the Apple Watch.
Why would you save bank app passwords on keychain?…
Ain’t no one safe…hide your kids, hide your wife, they shaking down everybody
The problem with this could be fixed just with adding an option for separate passcode for unlocking. For anything else the big trusty passcode.
Apple could easily add option to have two factor with a passcode and face/Touch ID scan. Considering most if not all apples devices that are supported support biometric auth, it’s a no brainier. Could do with removing the change iCloud password with pin
Not to minimize the issue here, and it s good there bringing this to peoples attention as it can enable them to take steps to avoid this happening. Like using a custom alphanumeric code much harder to memorize after seeing your Internet only a few times. Or using pyrometric authentication to unlock the device. However, all that said. I really think they should be focusing on more realistic issues with Apple. Like for instance, the AirPod fiasco. And how detrimental that is to the environment.
I didn't know that iPhone is so easy to steal, so I stay with Samsung
Welcome to Android.. After saying that I realize they are all the same. I just realized it's similarly vulnerable
Thank God for OnePlus oxygen OS AppLock... You lock all important apps with a secondary pin of 6 digits rather than 4
this is the dumbest report ever. So adults suck at being adults so let's blame companies for my wrong doing. I bet she had her passcode as 000000 people are just stupid they literally give you everything to secure it. I believe there is an option that doesn't require your passcode.
Blackberry used to have two separate passwords, one for the Lock Screen and one for the password vault. And it used to have picture password, where you put a chosen number on a specific part of a picture. It was basically unbreakable. Apple needs to have a picture password as a lock.
If they don't rob you on the iPhone, they will rob you somewhere else. Just be cautious EVERYWHERE!!!
Too bad apple, please fix it.
mine's asks for apple id password and some background questions to let me change apple password
Put a privacy screen protector to lessen the odds of someone seeing your passcode
SSO is such a critical vulnerability, yes it's convenient but when it fails...
wow. Amazing video. Thank you for the education
y'all just use faceID or touchID 😢
As always, it’s a case of convenience versus security.
Blaming Apple is pretty stupid here. 1. Don’t leave your phone laying around. Duh! 2. Quit announcing your passcode. Lower the phone when typing in the code and look around you before doing so.
The reporter didn't say one thing, that I believe most stupid idea from Apple, that is your iPhone will occasionally randomly ask for your passcode Lol 😂 (and Android following Apple with no brain ☹️🤷)

Happened to me many time, in public place, while I ordering my coffee, then I need to unlock my iPhone, and my smartphone is so "smart" to ask me to input my passcode in public eyes, where could be a lot of cameras, eyes . As well as Apple say, to double check security of my iPhone 😂

Usually, people will hurry to input their passcode without concern to cover the screen. Bcoz we are in the middle of doing things, the iPhone just stops its FaceID then turns to ask for a passcode 😂
This coverage really makes me want to rethink my risk assessment model. I would have to:
1. Change iphone passcode to alphanumeric p/w
2. Remove all sensitive entries in Keychain & delete 3rd party p/w mgr
3. Sign out and Delete all banking and c/c apps
4. Remove digital wallet payments
5. Do banking, payments etc. at home on a separate device.
6. Password protect personal or sensitive Notes in notes app. 
7. Remove home/work addresses in Maps apps 
Open to any thoughts or suggestions! 🙏🏻
Thank you for making this video! I just changed my 6 digit passcode to a 16 AN passcode 😊
I hope Apple will stop been an ostrich!
This is crazy! Just by knowing your passcode! 😮 @apple definitely need to do something about this
This is why you should never type in your passcode in public if you can avoid it. Use Face ID or Touch ID to unlock your phone. Avoid storing passwords in your iCloud Keychain. Use a strong password for your Apple ID and change it frequently. This isn't just an Apple issue. The same is true for Android users, even though iPhones are far more likely to be stolen.
That's why don't show your phone when inputting the passcode, atleast cover it or don't use a very simple passcode
How Apple still doesn't have TOTP 2FA is beyond me
It would help if Apple required icloud keychain a different passcode or password to access
In Brazil people are using two phones, one for their bank account and another one for the rest. And Apple is worse since Samsung at least has hidden folders.
Bottom line don’t loose your phone 
And Change your passcode frequently
This has been a problem in Brazil for years. Every day you listen to a story of someone who had their phone stoled, and all money withdrawn/transfered
Use face ID or fingerprint ID only.  It's important to NOT use the passcode except when the iPhone forces you to, and to cover up the keypad with your other hand when you type it in, and look around you to make sure no one is watching you type it in.  If someone is watching you, move to where no one is watching you before typing it in.
There's another thing people can do and that is to enable screen time with separate passcode and then in content & Privacy restrictions disable account changes and passcode changes that will effectively block Access to the Apple ID tab in the settings app
How do the thieves guess the correct Iphone pass code?
It's just stupid to save your bank account password in the iPhone's passwords tab... When my phone asks me if i wanna store a password i say NEVER. Just remember your passwords to avoid events like these
If you don't know enough about technology and fall for this, it's your fault. Yes, Apple's marketing is misleading, but in the end it's you who saved your private data on someone else's (Apple's) computer, trusted proprietary software blindly and you even merged both factors of your MFA into a single factor which is obviously stupid.
I use a 3rd party password manager which doesn't use my lock screen pin (although it does use my fingerprint or face ID). This way even if my phone is stolen while it's unlocked they wouldn't be able to get into my banking apps aside from Google Pay, which would allow me to dispute any charges if it were stolen. They would need my fingerprint, face ID, or the master password for my password manager to access my banking apps.

There are a few accounts that a thief would be able to access with just a backup code text to my phone number, but not any important accounts.
This is such clickbait but not surprising coming form WSJ. Only true if you're foolish enough to use passcodes instead of touchid or Face ID, input your 4 digit  passcode at a bar while drunk, still use 4 digit passcode instead of alphanumeric, and dumb enough to leave pics of your SSN and other documents in your photos! Moral of the story don't use a 4 digit passcode at a bar while drunk!
Why not just use the Face ID in public lol
create a secondary security code for some actions maybe?
Moral of the story: Don't go to sketchy bars in big cities.
Avoid typing your passcode into your phone when in public places, use biometrics!!!!
I stopped using my iPad for 2 years. Turned it back on to find my apple ID was deleted by  Apple. All the music albums I paid for gone. Photos gone, everything gone. But my Google account kept everything I've had for longer. Even old voice-mail from a friend who past away. I'm sticking with Google.
Hardware 2FA?  YubiKey?  Maybe?  Yes?  Anyone?
On Android you can use the full password with letters and symbols
If only Apple asked personal questions before changing apple id password. Like the name of your first dog. It's not that hard!
Bitwarden is also a good password manager
The big lesson do you really need to use you phone in a bar  ???
You have to be as careful with your phone as your wallet !!
Tip No. 4: buy a dumb phone to use for risky places as bars...
Thanks for giving every criminal a step by step guide on how to do this
and people keep buying stupid apple products. Go ahead I guess
This is terrible
$20 flash drive backed up once a month!
They should implement a second PIN code that only gets asked for important actions (changing the account password and other important stuff), that way it will not be easily seen by the thief (when you unlock your phone for example). Don’t know if my idea makes sense or is understandable.
How about not having bank info and apps in your phone
Use your face or fingers as your password with faceID or touchID all this happened because someone physically stole your pin and they can do the Sam’s with 6 digits or any passwords you put in and there is also support for 2AF with Ubi key so use that if needed
Set up your banking/financial apps to use a fingerprint to login.  Even if someone gets my unlocked phone (or unlocks it with a PIN), they cannot login to the banking apps on the unlocked phone because the app itself seeks a fingerprint at launch/login.  At least that's how it works in the Android universe.....
Honestly shocking how easy that is, this has to be fixed.  Apple should implement a secret pin that the user makes when they setup the phone, that needs to be input along with the passcode in order to make big changes such as change iCloud password.
Android users mainly use fingerprint, we don't need to rely on FaceID which isn't super reliable and users fallback to pass code
This is a huge oversight.. changing the Apple id should require the current password not the phone's passcode
Wait what happen to Face ID? Why is she not using Face ID?
Use Face ID or finger id, done.
Always memorize passwords for financial accounts! Don't save them to your phone, computer or any other device. If you write them, on paper only, and hide it in your house. If you live with others (roommates) don't even write it down.
That’s why we should use the strongest password manager there is for our banking apps: your brain.

but seriously apple should ask for entering old password and combinations of face id+ apple id password to change certain settings and people should not store their own apple password in keychain how stupid is that!

if you forgot your apple id password apple should provide an option to add another email id as backup option or ask some questions.
Or just use common sense and situational awareness instead of thinking your safe every where you go. People make themselves victims by not recognizing the criminal element is everywhere, all the time.
This is not an iPhone problem. It’s a public security and customer problem. To better protect yourself basic common sense is really all that is needed. Just use what I like to call a mobile phone. It’s a phone you only take with you to make calls, browse the web, listen to music and play games. It shouldn’t have all the apps you use to bank, pay your bill and receive important emails installed on it. Those are for your home computer. You should be able to voluntarily share your password with robbers without worrying about them stealing your money. And for your password use an Alphabetical Code, not a 6 digit Numeric Code. I can probably guess those. You’re welcome.
Nice piece!
Omg thanks for keeping us safe Joanne! You literally unlock a new fear! And I have all that set up on my 14 Pro Max! 😮
Seeing LastPass in the is video is disgusting given their recent breaches, lack of transparency and comparatively, poor security. I imagine this was an oversight.
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😎😎😎😎
I do not have a data plan on my phone, it's on something else.
Where there is a Will, there is a Way.  Both are in abundance.  Security is an Illusion.
Face ID, Touch ID!?  🤷🏻‍♂️
I’ve taken my bank accounts off my phone. I’m even thinking about getting a dumb phone.
So i just need a 3 layer passcodes for my phone??
One layer of phone passcode, secon layer for in phone app and diffent layer of passcode for bank app

Wait....., after checking it, turn out i got 4 layers for using an androi phone
Btw you can now use security keys to log into iCloud - won’t help with the local iPhone stuff but afaik that makes it impossible to change the password without one - also there’s a way to setup a recovery key or recovery contacts
Apple passwords can be longer than 6 digits but still things like finger I’d and Face ID would be safer in public
i thought that was clear for every body and that is why every one was annoyed with face id not working with masks
@WSJ Please edit the video and remove LastPas as a suggested password manager or add a note somewhere! This is misleading people on a solution with serious security concerns that enterprise are banning from being used! Dashlane and 1Password are the best choices.
That’s her fault for not using faceid 😂
Why do you need a credit card connected to your phone? Just use your computer. How often do you even need to use mobile banking anyway?

Second of all, are there seriously people who just keep everything on a cloud? Why wouldnt you want a hard drive with all of your photos? Why wouldnt you select your favorite ones and print them out at the end of every year?
4:17 press “Add Security Keys” 
iOS 16.3 has added support for FIDO U2F. Maybe this can act as a second layer of protection until they fix the password reset issue
Use fingerprint
Saving your bank app's password in the Apple password manager isn't a smart idea. In Turkish and Norwegian banks, it's actually not even possible. Those apps won't allow passcodes to be stored.
The woman being interviewed, I feel for her 😢 hopefully she can recover her photos, Apple can help her, but they won’t charge of course
I expect apple to patch this in a new update
Thats what you get for being a sheep lol. Hope she never gets her account back
Better solution, enable screen time and don’t allow account modifications.
Who knew buying a product from a scam company was a bad idea? Mind = blown
Would be a good video, however pointing people to Lastpass near the end after their breach a few months ago is inexcusable.
This is an easy fix......don't hang out at bars & you won't become a victim. 🤔
All the passcode should do is unlock the phone.
If you wanna change settings ALL of your accounts... that should be an apple ID password.
Or even better: it should require two out of three authentication methods
Fingerprint, FaceID, Passcode, AppleID Password.
That is the main issue of having everything with a single pin code or a password.

Android is better in that regard since you have the option to use a password over a pin which wouldn't let you change the password of your google account or Samsung account(if you use a Samsung phone) as well you can't use a password to use Samsung Pay or Wallet(if you use a Samsung phone).

Forgot to mention even if you use a pin in a google phone or Samsung phone you can't change the password of the accounts since it asks for the password itself first.

The only way to prevent that on the iPhone is by only using biometrics aka faceID over the passcode.
Most droid users have fingerprint IDs. This would have been useful as you don't have to enter your passcode. Having passwords stored natively is a bad idea, good point.
I cannot believe a pixel might be safer than my iPhone ridiculous
I know some people value the ease of having your passwords to sensitive accounts stored in your phone, but from day one that to me seems like the worse idea. Not even on my desktop do I have the passwords to my bank accounts, and other sensitive sites saved. Secondly, as a Samsung user I use secure folder (which has a different passcode) where I store some sensitive information in case of an emergency when I am traveling. Additionally, the email I use for my google account is not the email associated to my sensitive accounts.

Lastly, besides the fact that Apple can take easy steps to address the issue of a universal passcode (having a different passcode to unlock phone vs one for more sensitive info), along with other safeguards. They should bring back touch ID in whichever form. I am certain that many people who find themselves having to input their passcode at night stem from face ID potentially (understandably) not working as intended. Therefore, leading to people having to use their passcodes. Again Joanna brings up other steps to take, though I am not a fan of a one pass type of system.
8:28 WHY WSJ INSIST in still recommending LastPass??? Use 1Password.
Just use a very big passcode and FaceId
Samsung is looking pretty good •iPhone using•
Alphabet and number mixed them make uneasy passcode 
Like K7GRK7GR
Alpha numeric passcode!
How to protect yourself? Buy an Android.
If this headline had truly been written as clickbait, the author would have replaced "digital" with "financial." "Apple's iPhone Passcode Problem: Thieves Can Ruin Your Entire Financial Life in Minutes" is just as TRUE!
Thieves watching this video and taking notes 📝
Sounds like Cap, how would she get the email notification of a credit line opened in her name if her password had been changed on her iPhone?
How is she using iCloud for 15 years? The service is from late 2011. LOL
Also, why is everyone scared of using passwords? Passcodes are so easy to crack
Litterally JAW DROPPING, had no idea!
One important solution is missing in the video: using Screen Time with a different passcode to prevent account modifications. 🔐

Go to Settings > Screen Time:
- Hit “Use Screen Time Passcode” and pick a PIN that is different from any subset of your main passcode.
- Go to Content & Privacy Restrictions > Account Changes and set to Don’t Allow. 

When you go back to the main Settings screen you’ll see that the account badge is grayed out and settings there are not accessible.
If Apple had kept the fingerprint scanner till date , this kind of problems would have not arise 🖖
This is crazy!😮
NEVER trust "the cloud". Always backup your data offline.
I lose my number can’t back my apple Account
Why are you listing LastPass there? Yes it’s still better than KeyChain but they have proven to not handle password security with the care they should have!
Problem is real, solution is not
iPhone and Android phones should have layered security for apps
There is even more you can do, don't rely on cloud storage. Everything can happen in the cloud and yes "it's safe", until your passwords are changed. Just move the photo's to an usb harddrive. You don't have to acces your photo's from 2 years ago from the cloud. Keep this rule, don't touch it for an year, remove it. Another thing when at a bar, don't use your phone at all. Most of the times you are with friends so why look at your phone while your friend is next to you. Sending a whatsapp to your friend 2 feet away is so 2022. When you want to make a picture, the app can be access on your lock screen too, use that. Don't use the WiFi from the bar or hotel you're at, 4G works good enough.
Lol my phone still have fingerprint reader. I never use the password.
8:41 You've had so many options to choose from regarding the third party password managers you show but from all those you chose LastPass. I guess you could also just stick to the 4 digit passcode then😂
9 minutes of scary threats that could be solved with 1 tip: Use FaceID
Really good piece, I’ve never saved my banking or email passwords on any device for this reason. There are some passwords that you should only save in your personal memory (aka your brain). Also, make a local backup of all your photos, even without theft if Apples cloud got compromised you could lose everything.
Solution: Use an alphanumerical code instead of a simple, easy to guess, easy to spot, six-digit number.
I love Apple but I’m glad you’re doing this. They need to consider how these things happen to normal users and give customers a way to get their information and sanity back.
THANK YOU
Buy a 100 printer
Print 1,000 memories
I've been thinking about this issue lately; how I have everything in my life on my Apple and Google accounts, and knowing that if either were compromised I would lose everything.
This is huge enough to where they should address it by the next showcase.

Second Unlock code for apps on the protected list.

Biometrics and 2 unlock codes required to make “deep” account modifications
Why is her EYE BROW higher than the other?
That’s why i don’t like storing all my info on a cloud, the blink of an eye and all of it is handed over to someone else, for them to use. really feel for her losing 15 years worth of memories that she will likely never get back. I don’t think apple will care at all about helping her out either.
Apple need add Touch ID back on Face ID only iPhones.  To access password changing or personal settings, you would need two of the three biometric to access these settings. First Face ID with Touch ID, Face ID with passcode, Touch ID with pass code and so on. But you will need two of the three to access sensitivity information.
Should definitely allow us control which apps and what actions are allowed with passcode. Passcodes can be hacked in so many ways. Doesn't matter if you have 4 or 100 digits. All it takes is someone taking a video when you write them. 
Common security faults with apple secutiy
1. The prompt to confirm on a trusted device to accept the change should be with ALTERNATE devices only. Worst case let us set this as an option.
2. Allow people to identify what the passcode can be used for. Sure, I want to be able to unlock my phone when touch id will not work because hands are dirty. BUT I do not want the bank app to use it as a secondary confirmation method because... you now know why :)
3. In general, what people seem to be missing, 2FA (OTPs, etc) are not adding any security if the method of accessing them is as trivial as opening the Google Authenticator and using them.

And as a lot of people have already said, use a 3rd party password manager that you can use on all your machines however keep in mind that you data are stored on someone else's server. Servers with concentrated tons of passwords etc so they are naturally great targets for hackers. So when you select one, don't go with the cheapest one. Go with the one you REALLY trust. Do your research.
This is why I don't fool w/ 🍎 
THIS IS WHY I DONT FOOL W/ APPLE 
6:24
This is scaring me now.
i use my fingerprint to unlock my phone.   which is only a problem when i am working on my boat and fingerprints get scuffed.
the real reason is because security is flawed and easily exploited on an iphone.
Add Security Keys for your Apple ID, it provide users with the option to add a third-party security key to their account, which will be needed for authentication when logging into a new device or otherwise accessing an ‌Apple ID‌, problem solved, available since iOS 16.3, and use a open source password manager like KeePassium, bit warden
That is such a stupid implementation on Apple's part. 

This is why I've been nagging them so hard to just adopt the open standard TOTP for 2-Factor Authentication. Which let's you use either Security Key or ever-changing codes every 30 seconds, for you to continue to login with your Apple ID or change it's passwords. 

It's so stupid that they still refuse to adopt that and continues to be the only major tech company to not adopt it. Instead insisting on their proprietary Apple-devices based Two-Factor Authentication, which let's you send cloud based 2FA Codes to your other Apple devices, for you to log-in.

Not only that it doesn't work in Offline, it is also utterly cumbersome for you to reach to your other Macbook just to view the code and login.
It’s such a big issue. I hope apple sees this.
No, Android doesn't. Android never ask your screen lock passkey to unlock bankings apps. Contrary to belief Apple iPhones are the safest phone is a dumb decision. To be fair, for me online banking was never an option. You should blame Apple not just throw that away.
Best solution, avoid the apple ecosystem
Sounds like a situational awareness issue not an apple one. Take responsibility people
A good idea is to get a privacy screen on your phone so someone can’t see you input your passcode by sitting right next to you. Sure it won’t stop someone from putting a gun to your head but it is a step in the right direction.
These are very helpful. Hope Apple really rethinks the issue
Apple is stubborned to return touchid to the iphone
Do Americans bank not have extra passwords or pass number for bank transfers? 
I can’t believe Americans still don’t have chip and pin.
Talks about using third-party password manager then shows a screenshot that includes LastPass 🤦‍♂️ SMH Do your research before editing a video like this.
I assume it's so easy to change an icloud password in the phone's settings because so many users were forgetting them and coming into an apple store to get it fixed. If that's the case for the current system, I would think the fastest fix would be to require both the pin and biometric.That might mean iphone should have both faceID and touchID in case one fails. But I don't know how else to get a two-factor type of auth in the phone's settings. Any device ping, sms code, or email code would be accessible to the thief. Pin and biometric is at least testing knowledge and physical characteristic (face or fingerprint).


The problem is if the current system is in place due to customers constantly forgetting and being locked out of their icloud account, those same customers may be really hesitant to use biometric security. I guess I'm mainly thinking of my parents here, but they're convinced Russia, China, or whomever will steal their face and finger print if they use those methods on their electronics.
LastPass been hacked and lost everyones Keys lol
Don't play with your phone in bars or hide your phone screen when you are logging in.
A good solve for this would be the ability to use a second passcode (different from the unlock code) for stuff like accessing keychain and changing appleID password. Basically everything except unlocking the phone should have a separate password/passcode since unlocking is something we do a lot in public and sometimes the device forces to enter passcode instead of using faceID.
Wow, even though hardware keys are now compatible with iPhones, hardware key protection is not implemented by Apple as of iOS 16.3.1 this vulnerability is exploitable. Apple FAIL
Yeah, but why are they using pass codes instead of biometrics? 🤔
Apple needs to change it from asking the pin to your Apple ID password.
Do not use last pass
overpriced promises...
I’m just going to say it…make a better passcode?
Thanks for sharing my story!
1. Use faceID or don’t punch in your pin in public on a huge iPhone pro max 😬
2. Set a trusted number other than the # on your current devic (google voice, trusted friend’s #)
3. Set a recovery key and/or set a recovery contact
4. Buy and implement a security key for $10 each.. (Yubico)

Should be obvious but again, don’t  punch in your pin or password on a device that you use to store your digital life, passwords, financial accounts, etc, while socializing with strangers. 🤯
If people would have used TouchID or FaceID in the bar, the attack would not have been possible. Except if someone also steals your glass. But that would require an older iPhone.
I would highly recommend iPhone users to change the Account Changes in Screen Time to Don’t Allow - this will disable access to your Apple ID. Also, changing the Passcode Changes to Don’t Allow will hide the Face ID & Passcode option in settings. If I remember correctly you will be asked to create a new pin, which will used to gain access to these settings - this will be a different pin from the passcode to enter your phone.
What about deactivating the pathetic passcode? That way the thieves have no chance because of Face ID?
Or am I missing something?
Privacy screen protectors and you’re sorted. I think?
Apple needs to bring Touch ID back, also change how the password is changed on the iCloud account. I never understood why they don’t require you to reenter your old password to iCloud before you can change it too a new one. Like what?
Of all the Password Managers out there you guys chose to show Last Pass in the video lol
Now I see iPhone is more secure than android
This is not new. Here's a video from a year ago warning about this PIN issue on iPhone. https://youtu.be/EZn-j-4p7y8
I use an Alphanumeric long password for it.
that's why i dont save my bank passwords . what's so difficult in typing the password. people have become lazier
I don’t understand how apple can improve the situation? This is very similar to someone asking your passcode over a gun point. What would you do? What apple can do in that situation? Because this is still legit. How device would know this isn’t you and you are forced to give up password? FaceID can be helpful, however it isn’t reliable. We can’t get rid off passcodes and passwords. And these things can be stolen. 

Manufacturers are only concerned about security in network. Security from a hacker not from robber.

But yes, they shouldn’t be able to reset apple id with passcode. That is dumbest thing.
I would also add to turn off character preview so unwelcome eyeballs won't see which keys you're entering.
Samsung > Apple
lets go
This old news Apple ready fixtures this
That's why you should use biometric authentification methods. I use my fingerprints for authentification and set a whole complex password as code (with special characters, letters and all that good stuff (it was fairly easy to configure on my android device). Also it  locks the option to authenticate with finger print after 72 hours (or a restart/shutdown of the device) I also use high capacity micro sd cards in my phone to save my pictures and don't rely on any cloud solution. (They're backed up regularly with a NAS server)  I also use linux mint as my computers operating system with drive encryption. I also generally don't do any banking with my phone. Do these simple little things and you'll be unlikely to get stolen of everything valuable to you...
scary they see all your notes and photos and safed passwords in safari keychain
how they get the passcode in the first place? through some kinda software to crack it etc....?
Don't be lazy and think that you're safe if you're using biometrics. They are not superior to passcodes. They have different vulnerabilities, and most importantly, once compromised, cannot be changed. Listen to the plan she laid out. At least until Apple comes up with a better solution.
just one thing: don't use lastpass, its better than nothing and it was the best - some time ago. they have been breached because they had not been proactively protecting and still not transparently informing their customers - just saying, search the security leaders views on it. It's sad, but after more than 10 years I had to move away from lastpass, because facts made clear, they can't be trusted to keep you automatically protected.
I have always wondered how easy it is to basically get access to your entire life's digital data and digital asstes just by cracking 4/6 digit iPhone's passcode, now my idea has come to fruition.
these thieves are scum and everywhere, especially in Europe large cities.
My Apple ID once was hacked by some guy in pakistan and Apple helped me to take it back but the process took 2 weeks. But that was the case they didn’t have my iPhone.
People…..please just memorize your SSN. It’s not that hard.
Important please read iphone user
You can add another security that is in the setting just simply
1-Go to settings 
2-turn on screen ontime with a diffrent passcode it is 4 digit
3- go to content &privacy
4- diss allow passcode changes
5- dis allow account changes
This will disappear face id section in you settings so that you can change passcode or face id, and the other one can’t go to icloud section  gray, so that they dont change your password
More importantly, DON'T KEEP BACKUPS WITH APPLE.  It's not just a dig on Apple, it's a general problem of keeping the backups with the same company that is the source of the data.  Don't back all your stuff to iCloud, there are a dozen other cloud providers you might explore, but it's not a backup if you can't restore it with 100% certainty.  Keep a backup on your hard drive as well.  Banking transactions can be reversed, but you can't get those baby photos back if you don't have your own copy on a separate ecosystem that you can't be locked out of.  For eons people have asked Apple for "real identity recovery", where you can register your passport or drivers license so that in the future going to an Apple Store with your government ID grants you access to your stuff regardless of their automated recovery processes.  Apple has refused because it might enable their Apple employees to do bad things.  Employees should be audited and prosecuted, rather than leave customers out-of-luck.  It all boils down to their "we want to be able to tell customers we won't give their data to law enforcement" policy.  They tell the police that they "can't" unlock your Apple account for them as an obstacle to enable this policy.  They don't want to have to say they "won't", as legal penalties can be steep.  Customers like this are the bycatch of this policy.
It’s not Apple’s problem. It’s the user’s problem. If she had been more careful and used Face ID then she wouldn’t have to lose everything. The same thing happens with android devices, report that too WSJ. Americans always complaining about a simple problem which they can prevent from happening if they have been more cautious. Always trying to find somebody to blame. What a shame WSJ. What a shame! #unsubscribed 🙄🙄🙄
Isn't this entirely properly alleviated if you just use TouchID or FaceID? Not diminishing the gravity of the situation, but these crooks operate on a basis that uses the least secure method of access. A stolen phone is utterly useless if they don't have your face because the likelihood of guessing a 6 digit password is a 10 in 999,999 chance of getting it correct before you're locked out. Moral of the story don't be obvious and careless with your password in public theivery hotspots and always try to use face ID first. Plus if you have an apple watch the phone can just unlock via your wrist. If your phone gets stolen, immediately turn the watch off.
Stop drinking. Sober iPhone users don’t have this problem.
wsj you really recommended lastpass on here when they have suffered a severe breach of their systems in 2022 where unknown actors have stolen their backups of customer data. ????????????????????
really ?????????????
well any security is better than no security but .............
So much for SECURITY
Good thing your digital life is not the real life
Thank You Joanna, for your years long clear, humorous and down to the point reporting, that former colleagues traded with lifestyle chit chat... Well done, very relevant, continuously.
Yikes! This is truly frightening.
Yeah, don't drink.  "I was distracted." No, you weren't, you were drunk.
So much for Apple to commit to privacy protection features including advanced data protection and lockdown mode.
The least they could do is to require the current password to change it
Simple for Apple to fix in a quick update:

Don't allow a user to change their passcode with just their PIN which is used to unlock their iphone. They need both PIN AND Face ID. That would stop the user being able to change the account's password and thus the other things that follow.

Also adding in the same step for unlocking the password manager would mean they can't get in the Bank accounts.
Ugh, please don't recommend LastPass!
This is so scary.
Way to show every non-technical person out there a step-by-step on how to do this...
This truly sucks but the thieves would be really upset when they get in my bank and I have 18 dollars lol. Also they can't get in since I have a 3rd party authenticator for everything. Could lock me out of my phone if I used the passcode to unlock it which I generally don't.
Apple will add a self-destruction module on iPhone 15, armed with high explosives
Wise peoples said way earlier “don’t put all your eggs in same basket” so obey it & be attentive enough to everything around you
Lol at using Lastpass, which was just breached, as your example.
Apple needs to come up with a solution for this in IOS 17
Hence, i still use a bank booklet. All paper. All offline.
i don't like to nitpick usually but the captions service you hired did an awful job. it would be funny if you skimped on this budget-wise considering the size of your company
hahahahah my 000000 passcode its shaking right know
#1.2k👍🤷Why I only have a flip that is only a phone & dumb too.  Smart phones are for foolish people.  Old tech is safe.  These crimes are equal to horse theft 200 years ago.  Hanging is necessary too.
her: treat it like ATM code
me: ok, 1234 🤣
Android uses a fingerprint scanner and android users are leveraging 3rd party password managers. Resale value of the iPhone isn't the cause, iPhone ease of breaking in is the cause
That’s your fault to save any account that have to do with money.
I only save passwords if I want convenience.
goodluck loosers (proud idiot apple fans)
This is why I like my S23 Ultra, it requires ultrasonic biometrics, password, and 2-step verification each time; even if the phone is unlocked.
Thanks
Easiest solution: add old password as well when changing password for Apple ID. Duh
7:39
It should be passcode together with Face ID or Touch ID. One shouldn’t be a substitute of the other.
Apple recently added security keys. Enable that…problem solved
To change your iCloud password Apple shouldn't be asking for your 6 digit code it should be asking for your old iCloud password!
Seriously? Your banks in the country of freedom are connected with the security of your phone? And to transfer you don’t have double security? You are just a fail of a country
You can also configure Screen Time to block changes to the Apple ID, using a different passcode
This is a killer report. So good.
Focus on profit.....
long story short: thieves know iPhone's stupid face unlock does not work well in darkness so you will use passcode, thus they can look at it and learn. Simple solution, bring back fingerprint unlock, its faster safer and more reliable than face unlock
Yubikey!
Great reporting Joanna. Apple has some work to do.
There's a GREAT way to reduce this risk. Do it now. Setup Screen Time in your own device, create a password that is NOT the same password as the one to unlock the phone, go to Content & Privacy Restrictions and block Password Changes and Account Changes. Do this now, it might save you a lot of trouble.
omg first of all never put your saved passwords on your phone. i always wrote them down on my notebook and put it in my safe. bank cards never put them on my iPhone wallet i have worried that someone will hack it
If Apple just asked for the current Apple ID password instead of just needing the iPhone passcode to change passwords none of this would have happened.
This morning all my apps was deleted off my phone and couldn’t sign into my account
If we need to protect our PINs when using bank cards, the same criteria should be applied when entering the 6-digit codes on an iPhone.
A possible solution: To change the Apple ID password users have to enter both face ID or Touch ID with the passcode. And should not let users to change too my security info after signing in to a new device for 24hrs (wait for any phone lost complaints).  And finally make to send an access request prompt for two trusted devices (Watch, Mac, iPad) before any massive security change, and no further shall be allowed until both devices approve.

Apple should pretty much have to act like a bank where no one have to worry if their device lost. One should simply should get access to all their files by simply going to the Apple store and submitting all necessary biometrics.
Sounds like FaceID can solve this entirely
this happened to me a few months ago in Mexico City, my iPhone was stolen, I lost access to my apple id for a couple of weeks, and robbers transferred $20,000 USD from my accounts to their own. I talked about this here: https://youtu.be/G8osAuhHwuw
I am always sceptical about "victims" when they very rarely have ANY accountability....yes thieves will always exist and you need to be aware...sad but your responsibility...take on some after the fact!
It has been happening in Brazil for a while too. I would recommend also locking the SIM Card.
dont buy iphone.  get a cheap android no one wants to steal.
My background is in IT security. In helping friends with iPhone issues I've found that apple's ID scheme is usually more trouble and more risk than it's worth. My advice: Use an Androud phone. Use an alphanumeric password. Don't keep pictures of sensitive data on your phone (they get saved to the cloud on Apple and Android by default). Use a password manager separate from the phone's manufacturer. Don't use Apple pay or Google pay. Or, if you do, don't connect them to your bank or credit cards. Same advice with vendors. Don't use your Apple or Google account to login to your social media accounts, bank accounts,  investmentaccounts,  etc. (i.e., login with Google,  login with Apple). Create separate credentials for each account. That if your Apple or Google account is hacked, the hacker can't get into anything else.
Situational awareness helps
Why don’t they have Face ID on?
Apple should consider verifying the old AppleID password before allowing the user to reset a new one
« This iPhone can be used to change your password because you are signed into iCloud and have a passcode enabled »
The issue is right there

There MUST be the current passcode + the old password of the iCloud account
So this is actually a quick fix unfortunately, it seems a lot of people just want to have the simplicity of having a six digit password. This is not something that is the only option for your password. You can go into settings, and instead of using Face ID you can have a typed out password just like on your computer. Or you don’t have to get the latest iPhone you can actually use Apple’s iPhone SE with touch ID. Honestly, stay away from the six digit pin if you must even know what a simple this, of course could all have been avoided by not using the six digit pin, and typing in a full password like you do on your computer.
Thank you! I’ve been telling this for years and it’s mind boggling that a company like Apple, who spends millions of dollars in security every year, have not seen this simple and easy to fix issue with their devices.
Simple solution: Just use an alphanumeric code and your biometric identification in public only.

Here’s what I know, the advice here in the video is all important, and should be followed. Also, ID’s allow for physical Security Keys, so set up a physical two factor so you are never locked out of your  ID. 
The physical two factor key should be allowed to be used in more areas, so you aren’t as reliant on your number as a two factor method. 
Also, under Security, in your  ID Settings on your iPhone; you can set up recovery contacts as well, so you can have a trusted friend or family member assist you in retaining access to your  ID.
I hope  does more to fix this security vulnerability soon. Until then; be careful of who you trust, and be aware of those around you. Stay safe.

Like 10 years ago, there was a overall sense of “be careful with your phone, especially if it’s an iPhone because it’s a “luxury” brand” but now people just don’t care and also don’t care to understand tech, even at its basic levels. It’s SUPER easy to break into anyone’s phone if you want to, people just listen to Apple and take them at their word when they say when they say it’s super secure, has iCloud lock, locked after so many tries, etc. just educate yourself and be careful.

Plus there are ways to ensure your phone is locked down and won’t be accessed by anyone, especially if you’re with friends.
The issue is that when you loose your MacBook you can configure a password that can be different to the native password of your Mac

It’s not the case of the iPhone
When it doesn’t have a password, one can be configured
But if one is already configured there is no method to change it…

So if someone just guess your password (please don’t use dates) all your data gonna be available to the thieve

I don't think you're better off with a third-party password manager. You're trading one set of risks for another. LastPass was recently compromised, for example.
I understand the main premise on this story is that having the passcode for a phone allows a thief to reset your apple id password. However, it is still good to safeguard yourself with some of the following suggestions to prevent thieves from getting to that point of rest.

Here are the ideas:

1. Always use face id or touch id in public -- personally i think this is easier than entering a code anyway. 

2. Change your passcode to be longer than 6 numeric digits if you are concerned about others hacking your passcode-- apple lets you have long numeric passwords or even alphanumeric passwords (this doesn't entirely matter though if they are recording you enter your password anyway).

3. Set up 2FA

4. Use a password manager

5. Apps like Venmo allow you to enter a pin specific to that app (allows for face id access also) -- implement this with supported apps that you wouldn't want a bad actor to get into to bring havoc on your life.
This is the problem with cost cutting measures like eliminating real call centers and relaying on only chat/email/ect.
This is so dumb on Apple and there is still no solution to this day
Great video.  Apple needs to be pressured to do MUCH better here. 

Our ENTIRE functional lives, and the ability to get anything done, are now on these phones.  

Lose your phone, or your phone gets stolen and falls into nefarious hands, and you are absolutely screwed.  

They need to go to a two-password system to access and change sensitive data on the phone, and all apps should have the ability to be INDIVIDUALLY locked.  

Photos should also all be locked by default.
Many thanks to Reyhan Ayas for coming forward for this interview.
Lesson number 1: Don't go to the bar!
I don’t use keychain and use Bitwarden instead this might help me hahah. If Face ID doesn’t work , it’s not the passcode to unlock
Where financials are concerned NEVER save the password , EVER !
Hope Apple can bring Touch ID back, cuz a lot of time Face ID just don’t work reliably so you have to use the passcode to login the phone.
I’m sorry but how is this even possible?
I mean it’s three generations since Face ID even if you were drunk, you would be able to log in without using a passcode
Or just use biometric auth and don't show your pin in public
Can’t security keys prevent this problem?
DO NOT use a 3rd party password manager. Last pass just got hacked. Having all your passwords in one place is a huge opsec vulnerability.
Don’t use LastPass as a password manager. Use something else
Stay out of bars.
the lesson is to use face or touch ID always
Shouldn't be allowed to access any money with just the passcode. In my country all banking apps and e-wallets require an additional passcode, password or face id
Woah! I didn’t realize what could be done just by knowing your passcode. Great job reporting as always!
Never use password manager for banks and cards.
A possible solution: Face ID or Touch ID must be required from your device to change any Apple ID passcode. Also, a secondary passcode should be enabled for users to regain control.
Apple has to fix this. It’s very dangerous
I am never buying an Iphone even if I have a Million Dollars in my Bank Account
- A Happy Android User
Which moron has their bank password in their password manager????
I feel so sorry for this victims! Apple need to take actions.
Why doesn’t Apple make it impossible to turn off Find My IPhone
one additional suggestion to limit damage/time spent to recover from such theft if in the us: freeze your credit report with each of the 3 reporting companies  (experian, equifax, transunion). only unlock when you need to have your credit checked.
Cant be true, New York is the best and richest city on earth
Face ID is the solution.
So much for apples privacy boasting ads 🤣🤣
they could fix this by requiring the current Apple ID passcode not just the phone passcode to change the Apple ID passcode
ha! not LastPass
Bar, intoxication, carelessness, female. Wait.. am i seeing a trend here?
Install the latest IOS on all your devices and enable Fido certified Security keys.
Changing Apple ID should really require both fingerprints and facial recognition and not just a 6 digit passcode
finger print sensor better protection for passcode by default
But why would you even enter your passcode if you have face id or touch id?
Once my iPhone 8 was stolen in a gunpoint robbery. The problem I faced was I had two-factor authentication turned on (apparently we cannot turn it off now even today). I tried to log in to my iCloud to find my iPhone but couldn't because 2factor sent a text to my phone which I didn't have and made no sense. After a few hours, I was able to get in but it was too late.
Yes, very true. 
Awareness discussion, good WSJ.
Lesson for this video: while in public, use biometrics authentication so that you don't leak your passcode. While interacting with authorities, use passcode because they can use biometric to unlock your phone but not your passcode because biometrics is "who you are" and not "what you know" so the 5th don't apply and the pigs can unlock your phone that way.
Maybe this is actually a controversial guerilla marketing tactic by Samsung to promote the competent security and relative undesirability of their latest Galaxy phones
How about a grace period or pause if suspicious multiple activity is detected.
Or…don’t hand over all your information to a phone!
What is the point of having FaceID/TouchID if with a simple Passcode you can bypass the ENTIRE security stack!
Why does Apple give the same power to the Passcode as with the FaceID?
That's not how it works but ok. No one is recording users in bars hoping they enter their passcode. Here is a better tip; Don't get your phone lost or stolen. I don't need the passcode; I need the sim card. For financial stuff, a linked device/sim card should always stay in a safe place.
4:18 Wow that easy?
@8:43 use anything other than LastPass 😪
Simple ish solution, but if biometrics were required as well as the password wouldn't this solve the issue?
Only time you need passCode is when you restart your phone...... for every other time just use fingerprint sensor.
Is it just me or is it something very simple that on the iphone or anywhere else, to change the password for the icloud account should just be original icloud password, which should have been different from the original iphone password?
Why doesn’t Apple create a separate passcode for settings?
1st world country problems
Thank you for the 3 lesson.
lol I have a 4 digit pin, but I treat my phone as a limb, good luck taking it
If she has enabled 2fa on her Apple ID it wouldn’t have been this easy. Why is this not a recommendation in the video to enable 2fa on all accounts snd not just rely on the passcode.
Laughs in Android
Excellent story.  I’ll be making changes where needed… and avoid bars😛
Also apple need to ask a question before changing the Apple ID password…
Faceid
What I don’t understand is that she still remember her password. Can’t they rollback the password so that she can have access on her account. Apple won’t be able to view or change the password.
I personally think Fingerprint unlock is a must even if there is Face Unlock. 
Separate Bank Pin should be enabled.
We have UPI in India for bank transfer they have separate 6 digit pin for transfer
They rely too much on the phone to remember their password. I automatically write the password and never let the phone remember my password.
There's another one that's popular it's called simswap. Where the thief swaps your sim to there phone then they get full access to your 2FA codes and go into your email and all your accounts and make large purchases and drain your accounts etc etc. Be safe out there.
i am from India; while i was in cinemas or restaurants I could see people's passcode; funny that most of them were all zero.
Apple pay doesn't work in India because govt doesn't allow apple to use a face id or passcode to complete a transaction, as it requires a separate pin.
Really!!! ru blaming apple or android for this?? I thought the hacker found the hack to exploit the passcode. Reporting is so misleading.
These are targeted multi-step schemes. The victims did not take the proper steps to protect their account and device. Theft alone will not grant the thief access to your account. As much as it sucks, this is not the manufacturers fault.
You are forgetting the fact that the eSim is a factor in this equation. Brazilians suffers from this kind of iJacking since the sms authentication comes always to the phone and you cannot protect the sim card.
Everyone please use a good third party password manager & use 2FA. Preferably some security keys for your very important accounts who will allow it
Only an idiot enters their passcode in a public place. Use face id or fingerprint.
Fingerprint is better
There should be a Lockin Period of 24 hrs. in case user don't know its current password & wants to create new.
Protect your passcode!  I had a phone stolen a few years back but they did not have my passcode - I protect that carefully. I thought this story would be about some manner thieves could hack the passcode. People are not cautious enough - this is a human failure,
I think the lesson learned is to be more careful when using your phone in public, maybe a 6-digit passcode is not long enough especially if they can use a 6 digit passcode to basically ruin your life.
Come to Samsung
Why apple doesn't lengthen the passcode?? To 12 or 18 digits.
I’m a good Apple customer. 😊
Lesson is : be patient and only use face or fingerprint ID in public places.  Also, stop looking at your phone so much in bars,  experience reality, nothing more annoying than going out to a bar and finding phone zombies!
Promoting Lastpass? Lol
...Or just be cautious where you enter your passcode.
As a software developer, PLEASE STOP buying ICloud
Do iphones have finger print scanners??
always use android
This ecosystem open a whole new room of problems
Having your password changed so easily with only the passcode is just wrong. Apple should fix this with 2 factor authentication.
Hold Apple accountable
why is a 6 digit phone passcode enough to change your apple id password, this is mental. who came up with that
Why are people using passcodes?  Face id or fingerprint.
8:14 #2 is very important
Face ID is a thing tho
That's why finger print biometric is more secure. The thieves chose night time bar environment because it's dark and iphone users key in passcode to unlock phone.
It just goes to show whether Apple, android or any company. Nothing is safe anymore.
Locks are for honest people. Someone will always find a way to get around the system. Sounds like someone has inside information.
This is stupid. So many passcodes are impossible to remember!! That is why people always use the same password for everything.
Very important topic
I’m a good digital customer; I back everything up to an external hard drive. None of this, “the cloud will protect me” naïveté.
No me gusta.
APPLE OMEGALUL.
first
Scary I never hold my iPhone in street ever I see many walking looking at their phones dangerous. I don’t use Apple Pay my bank is totally separate to my phone. I never store images of valuable documents on my phone only worthless pictures of holidays is on my phone.
